We have searched archives, contacted researchers, and scanned the primary and grey literature to collate 3,665,221 records of marine phytoplankton species from Australian waters from 1844 to the present. Many of these are small datasets collected for local questions, but combined they provide over 170 years of data on phytoplankton communities in Australian waters. Units and taxonomy have been standardised, obviously erroneous data removed, and all metadata included. We have lodged this dataset with the Australian Ocean Data Network (http://imos.aodn.org.au/), allowing public access. The Australian Phytoplankton Database will be invaluable for global change studies, as it allows analysis of ecological indicators of climate change and eutrophication (e.g., changes in distribution; diatom:dinoflagellate ratios).

Environmental monitoring should provide the data sets that are necessary to: (1) track and predict changes in productivity and ocean state; (2) respond to immediate questions posed by clients; (3) alert clients to short- and long-term environmental/ecosystem changes; and (4) provide adequate historical databases to address future issues. For example, environmental monitoring is needed to understand environment-fisheries interactions; to detect trends in climate changes as a basis for rational predictions; to validate oceanographic models; and to provide historical and on-line data for development and exploitation activities in fisheries, oil and gas, and marine transportation \n",

The phytoplankton abundance data are analysed as per Richardson et al 2006. It is advised that anyone using the data should first read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the CMAR laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII). Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the IMOS data portal: http://imos.aodn.org.au/webportal/ For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006.

      "Since November 1995, the CARIACO Ocean Time Series program has been studying the relationship between surface primary production (carbon fixation rates by photosynthesis of planktonic algae), regional hydrography, physical forcing variables (such as the wind), and the settling flux of particulate organic carbon in the Cariaco Basin. This tectonic depression, located on the continental shelf of Venezuela, shows marked seasonal and interannual variation in hydrography and primary production induced in part by the regular migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).\n",
      "The Cariaco Basin hydrography is affected by North-Atlantic gyre-scale processes, including dispersal of Subtropical Underwater and western boundary current variability, cross-equatorial flow of water masses (Wust, 1964; Muller-Karger et al., 1989), wind-driven upwelling compounded by geostrophic circulation (Richards, 1975; Muller-Karger and Aparicio-Castro, 1994i), ventilation forced by Caribbean Sea eddies (Astor et al., 2003), and river discharge (Yarincik et al., 2000; Lorenzoni, et al. 2009). Due to its restricted circulation and high primary production, the basin is anoxic below ~250 m (Muller-Karger et al., 2001; 2010). In the late 1990's and early 2000's, CARIACO observations measured annual primary production rates of more than 500 gC/m²y, of which over 15-20% was generated by events lasting one month or less. Since 2004 there has been a decrease in primary production rates (annual averages of less than 400 gC/m²y). Still, the annual primary production rates in the Cariaco Basin are comparable to rates estimated using time series observations for Monterey Bay (460 gC/m² y; Chavez, 1996), and higher than rates estimated for Georges Bank, the New York Shelf, and the Oregon Shelf (380, 300, and 190 gC/m² y, respectively; Walsh, 1988). Primary production and vertical particulate organic matter fluxes in the Cariaco Basin are higher than those observed at the oligotrophic BATS and HOT locations (Karl et al., 2001; Steinberg et al., 2001; Thunell et al., 2007). The Basin also experiences sedimentological events caused by earthquakes (Thunell et al., 1999; Lorenzoni et al., 2012) and coastal flooding (Percy et al., 2008; Lorenzoni et al., 2009). All of these phenomena can influence the sediments.\n",

Whole water samples were preserved with acid Lugol’s solution, and 2 to 50 ml aliquots were settled in chambers for 6 to 24 hours (Utermöhl 1958). Phytoplankton cells were then counted and identified using a phase-contrast inverted microscope at 125x magnification, all cells greater than 30 μm diameter were enumerated. Cells smaller than 30 μm were counted at 1250x magnification; following the APHA (1989) strip count method, at least 100 cells of the most numerous taxon were counted. Cell volumes were estimated from measured linear dimensions and geometric formulas that varied with cell shapes. Phytoplankton samples representing 923 distinct date, station and depths were included. The 16,442 entries in this dataset include 609 different taxa within 11 functional groups. Diatoms dominated the total biovolume contributed by each functional group (77%) followed by dinoflagellates (14%) and cryptophytes (4.5%).

The greatest diversity of species occurred between 55° and 60°S, just north of the Antarctic Convergence. Maximum concentration was found at 70° to 72°S, where Corethron crioplhilum was profoundly dominant. A predominately sub-Antarctic assemblage between 52° and 64°S was dominated by nine species not found in significant quantities elsewhere in the series of samples. Only two of these extended in appreciable numbers into the Ross Sea. Six of the commonest species ranged from sub-Antarctic waters southwards across the Antarctic Convergence, and two were not recorded north of the Ross Sea.\n",

The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.

This dataset covers the entire coastal and shelf region of Australia and dates back to 1938. Most records are for copepods, but there are also data for other taxa such as decapods, chaetognaths, thaliaceans, appendicularians and cladocerans. Metadata are provided for each record, including dates, coordinates and information on mesh size and sampling methods. To facilitate analysis across the multiple datasets, we have updated the species names according to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS; http://www.marinespecies.org/about.php) and converted units to abundance per m3.

The key to getting reliable scientific data is to use standard survey methods so that everyone is collecting data in the same way over time at all sites. A monitoring guide developed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada presents an intertidal surveying methodology. The method is presented in a logical step-by-step manner starting from selecting a study area through each type of measurement to entering the field data into the database, and finally, reporting the results. After a few days of training in habitat mapping and species identification, community members can use these step-by-step protocols to routinely monitor their site of interest or concern. The challenge is to distinguish natural changes from human-induced ones over time. Nevertheless, the resulting data will help us all to gain a better understanding of these dynamic ecosystems, and to make wiser decisions about coastal development and marine conservation.\n",

      "AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project of CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a disecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the CMAR laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII).

Using ArcView GIS software, the digitized habitat maps are stratified. Smapling sites are randomly selected within these strata to ensure coverage of the entire study region and not just a particular reef or seagrass area. At each site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and benthic composition information is then quantified following standardized protocols. By relating the data collected in the field back to the habitat maps and bathymetric models, BT is able to model and map species level and community level information.

With the introduction of the Campelen trawl came a major change in the taxonomic detail recorded and by 2008 efforts were made to identify all fish to species, when possible. However although improved, identifications of some invertebrate taxa continue to be recorded at higher taxonomic levels.

With the introduction of the Campelen trawl came a major change in the taxonomic detail recorded and by 2008 efforts were made to identify all fish to species, when possible. However although improved, identifications of some invertebrate taxa continue to be recorded at higher taxonomic levels.   Consequently  the absence of records for a particular species cannot be equated with an absence of the species, particularly when higher taxonomic classifications are present.\n",

The NBI is a data source for the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and provides additional source of data on marine-benthic invertebrate species from studies conducted throughout the United States. The NBID component provides a basis for fulfilling important data needs of customers, such as providing information on the incidence and patterns of occurrence of a particular species of interest, or on the overall composition and diversity of species assemblages within any particular region of interest. Other key objectives of the NBID component are: (1) to provide a source of information for assessing patterns in marine biodiversity; (2) to provide input data for evaluating biological responses to sediment-associated stressors, and for developing new diagnostic tools to enhance such analyses; and (3) to provide a basis for monitoring the incidence and patterns of invasive species in marine and coastal waters (taking advantage of the fact that such a comprehensive database includes species from most all known marine invertebrate phyla, and thus will be broadly representative). Samples were live-sieved in the field on 0.5mm wire mesh sieves and all material retained on the screen was preserved with 10% buffered formalin with Rose Bengal dye. In the laboratory these previously fixed samples were re-sieved and transferred to a 70%-ethanol solution. All benthic macro-infauna retained on the 0.5mm screen were identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level, usually species. The level of taxonomy varied depending upon the salinity of the habitat from which the samples were collected. Oligochaetes and chironomids from tidal fresh and oligohaline salinity zones were identified to species (or lowest possible taxon) whereas individuals of these groups from higher salinities (&gt; 5 ppt) were not identified to the species level. Additionally, certain faunal groups were not identified to the species level due to inherent taxonomic difficulties associated with the group and the limited value to be gained relative to the effort required for the additional level of detail. These groups and the corresponding level of expected taxonomic classification are as follows: Phylum Porifera (Sponges); Phylum Ectoprocta (Bryozoans); Class Hydrozoa - Order (e.g., Hydroida, Actinulida); Class Hirudinea; Class Anthozoa - Order [e.g., Alcyonacea (soft corals), Gorgonacea (sea fans and whips), Pennnatulacea (sea pens), Actiniaria (sea anemones), Scleractinia, (stony corals), Ceriantharia]; Other Dipteran Families - Family (e.g., Ceratopogonidae, Chaoboridae). All benthic macroinfauna (&gt; 0.5mm) were identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level, usually species.

      "AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project of CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a disecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the CMAR laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII). Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the IMOS data portal: http://imos.aodn.org.au/webportal/ For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006.

Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the Australian National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series.

      "Over the last decade, the Integrated Marine Observing System’s Animal Tracking Facility (IMOS ATF) has established a permanent array of acoustic receivers around Australia to detect the movements of tagged marine animals in coastal waters. Simultaneously, IMOS ATF developed a centralised national database (https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au/) to encourage collaborative research across the user community and provide unprecedented opportunities to quantify individual behaviour across a broad range of taxa. Here we present the database and quality control procedures developed to collate 48.5 million valid detections from 1891 receiving stations. This dataset consists of detection data for 3523 tags deployed on 117 species (fish, sharks, rays, reptiles, and mammals), with distances travelled ranging from a few to thousands of kilometres. This dataset of acoustic detections constitutes a valuable resource facilitating meta-analysis of animal movement, distributions, and habitat use, and is important for relating species distribution shifts with environmental covariates.\n",

This dataset has been summarized by reducing the detection records to the count of detections per animal per site per day (UTC). The DwC field eventId has been used to record the transmitter serial number.

Simply stated, an estuary which has been degraded by human activity may have fewer species or fewer individuals of certain species or more of other species than a healthy, undisturbed estuary. Other objectives of CAMP included the development of an outreach program for the DFO to interact with Environmental Non-Governmental Organization (ENGOs) to raise awareness of the ecology of estuaries and bays in sGSL and to acquire baseline data on abundance, diversity and coastal community assemblage for future comparisons.\n",

The dataset was created for the Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEW) for use in profiling of the North Marine Region during the development of a marine bioregional plan for the region. Data from all voyages are in a single set of tables and in the same structure and measurement units. The aim of the dataset is to provide convenient access to the data from the source datasets, which were stored in various data structures in various locations. Although the data are presented in uniform measurement units of counts and weights per unit area, data from different samples cannot be assumed to be comparable. In particular, the catchability of a species varies among types of sampling gears. Even samples from a given gear type on a given voyage may not all be comparable to one another. For example, gear may be altered during a voyage (e.g. multiple codend mesh sizes may be tried) and fish trawls are occasionally aimed at fish visible on the echo sounder. The data should therefore be analysed no more than semi-quantitatively. Assumptions on the comparability of samples -- even from a single voyage and gear type -- should be based on reference to the voyage reports.\n",

Using a combination of field work and a 3D coupled physical-biological model, the research explores whether (i) larvae are distributed randomly within the Strait, or whether (ii) there exist clear “hotspots” for larval production and/or predictable transport corridors. Determining these dispersal patterns is an important step in developing future conservation strategies, and in the effective design and placement of envisioned marine protected areas. Comparing contemporary field data with historical data collected by DFO in the 1960s and 1980s, allows examining whether there have been any shifts in the species composition of these communities.\n",

      "Vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) are any ecosystem that are highly vulnerable to one or more kinds of fishing activity or other disturbance, and are identified by the vulnerability of their components (e.g. habitats, communities or species). The South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention includes specific provisions to protect VMEs. SPRFMO has defined ten benthic invertebrate taxa that are regarded as indicators of VMEs. They are: Porifera (sponges); Actiniaria (anemones); Alcyonacea (soft corals); Gorgonacea (sea fans); Pennatulacea (sea pens); Scleractinia (stony corals); Antipatharia (black corals); Stylasteridae (hydrocorals); Crinoidea (sea lilies); and Brisingida (armless stars). For management purposes, it is important to know where VMEs are known or likely to occur, based on the best available scientific and technical information. The likely presence of VMEs can be identified using habitat suitability models for indicator taxa, ideally across the entire SPRFMO area. This is the aim of the South Pacific VME project. Records of VME indicator taxa extracted for the SPRFMO area and the New Zealand EEZ from OBIS (Online Biogeographic Information System: www.iobis.org) together with other online data sources, and data from research institutes (e.g., NIWA, CSIRO) and fisheries agencies (e.g. MPI, AFMA) were used for the project. These data were compiled and groomed prior to use in the habitat suitability modelling. Data in this dataset represent records of the VME indicator taxa as extracted from the variety of data sources listed above and may include records that are outside of the SPRFMO area.\n",

Not only are there many species of these groups found in the Antarctic (387 sponges, 141 corals, 320 bryozoans and 337 hydroids) but they also form vital habitats for countless other organisms. The habitats formed by these megafaunal organisms are increasingly being recognized as both vulnerable and important ecosystems. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) adopted a proposal to declare two areas of the Southern Ocean as Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs).

Christmas Island National Park is 85 km2 in size and makes up almost two thirds of Christmas Island. The robber crab (Birgus latro) is categorised as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List, and Christmas Island is thought to have one of the largest remaining populations. Robber crab road mortality appears to vary with changes in traffic density. Since the opening of the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre in late 2009, thousands of robber crabs have been run over on the island's roads in line with the increased population and vehicular traffic, especially at night. Park staff began marking the location of road kills using pink marker paint to denote the sites and make them visible in January 2010. Basic data are collected at the site (sex, size, date, coordinates). To manage the impact of road mortality on the species, this monitoring project is designed to assess: spatial variation in road mortality across the island; temporal variation in road mortality; the relationship between traffic levels and mortality; and size and sex relationships.\n",

      "What are the greatest sizes that the largest marine megafauna obtain? This is a simple question with a difficult and complex answer. Many of the largest-sized species occur in the world’s oceans. For many of these, rarity, remoteness, and quite simply the logistics of measuring these giants has made obtaining accurate size measurements difficult. Inaccurate reports of maximum sizes run rampant through the scientific literature and popular media. Moreover, how intraspecific variation in the body sizes of these animals relates to sex, population structure, the environment, and interactions with humans remains underappreciated. Here, we review and analyze body size for 25 ocean giants ranging across the animal kingdom. For each taxon we document body size for the largest known marine species of several clades. We also analyze intraspecific variation and identify the largest known individuals for each species. Where data allows, we analyze spatial and temporal intraspecific size variation. We also provide allometric scaling equations between different size measurements as resources to other researchers. In some cases, the lack of data prevents us from fully examining these topics and instead we specifically highlight these deficiencies and the barriers that exist for data collection. Overall, we found considerable variability in intraspecific size distributions from strongly left- to strongly right-skewed. We provide several allometric equations that allow for estimation of total lengths and weights from more easily obtained measurements. In several cases, we also quantify considerable geographic variation and decreases in size likely attributed to humans.\n",

Beside it, a beach nourishment was conducted at Mariakerke (681243m³) and Middelkerke (968754m³). For the Mariakerke area, we collect biological and sedimentological samples in the impact area and in a control area (Bredene), before as after the suppletion, whereas for Middelkerke only the data after suppletion was part of the study. We monitor the marine ecosystem with a focus on the fauna within the sediment (macrofauna) and on the sediment (hyperbenthos, epi- and demersal fish fauna) in the intertidal zone and subtidal zone. In both studies, the subtidal area is the zone between the low water line and the 6m depth line and the intertdial area is the zone between low and high tide water line.\n",

The two sampling sites are characterised by a continuous hard bottom habitat with dense algal coverage and a moderate wave exposure and are not impacted by detectable anthropogenic activity. At each site, five random replicate units were collected from each depth of 1m, 5m, 10m, 15m and 20m by placing a plexiglas frame (25x25 cm) on the substrate and scraping the framed area completely. The samples were then collected with an underwater suction device working with pressure from a diving bottle. Samples were washed through a 0.5 mm mesh sieve and fixed in 99% ethanol. In the laboratory, all samples were identified to the most precise taxonomic level possible, using the most recent literature for the taxon. \n",

The photo transects were established as long-term biodiversity monitoring sites to monitor the impact of human activity, including climate change, on the region’s benthic marine biota in accordance with the protocols of the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program established by the Council of Arctic Flora and Fauna. These images were analyzed in a techncial report that summarises the epibenthic megafauna found in seven image transects from the Disko Fan Conservation Area. A total of 480 taxa were found, 280 of which were identified as belonging to one of the following phyla: Annelida, Arthropoda, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Chordata, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, Mollusca, Nemertea, and Porifera. The remaining 200 taxa could not be assigned to a phylum and were categorised as Unidentified. Each taxon was identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level, typically class, order, or family. The summaries for each of the taxa include their identification numbers in the World Register of Marine Species and Integrated Taxonomic Information System’s databases, taxonomic hierarchies, images, and written descriptions. The report is intended to provide baseline documentation of the epibenthic megafauna in the Disko Fan Conservation Area, and serve as a taxonomic resource for future image analyses in the Arctic.\n",

      "This dataset contains the species occurrence records collected as part of a stude designed to describe the occurrence and distribution patterns of several relatively ubiquitous indigenous species of Foraminifera observed in the Minas Basin. The study area environment is unique due to its exceptionally large tidal range creating currents well in excess of that required to erode and transport Foraminifera. The data was collected from 120 sediment samples collected during the spring and autumn of 1976. Spring samples in late May were collected from CSS Dawson using a medium Van Veen Grab (30cm x 30cm). The autumn samples were collected in September and October from a small boat using an Ekman grab (18cm x 18cm) or on foot. Samples were collected in water depths ranging from 1m to 25m.\n",

      "This is a combined dataset originating from two projects: NaGISA (Natural Geography in Shore Areas, a long term monitoring project following a global protocol) and a study on the Benthos of Haifa Bay. Specimens from Israel were collected on 31.5.2009 and 11.10.2009 in Haifa Bay, (Israel, Eastern Mediterranean Sea) from soft sediments of mixed grain sizes in shallow waters. Sediment samples were taken with a Van-Veen grab (KAHLSICO, model WA265/SS214) 32x35cm, volume 20 l, penetration 20 cm. The sediment was preserved in buffered formalin 10% for 3–7 days, then sieved through a 250 µm mesh sieve and subsequently stored in 70% ethanol. Specimens from Crete were collected in September 2007 and June 2008 from two sites in northern Crete characterized by a continuous hard bottom habitat with dense algal coverage and a moderate wave exposure. At each site, two vertical transects with sampling depths at 1 m, 5 m, 10 m, 15 m and 20 m were defined and five replicates were taken from each transect and depth.Samples were collected by means of SCUBA diving according to the NaGISA protocol (Iken and Konar 2003). A plexiglas frame (25 x 25 cm) with a net of 0.5 mm mesh size attached to its top opening was placed onto the rock and the surface within the frame was scraped off. The sample was collected by a manually operated suction device, supplied by air from an extra scuba tank. Large particles (&gt;2 cm) were collected manually after suction. The samples were subsequently washed through a 0.5 mm mesh sieve, fixed and preserved in 99% ethanol. Specimens were examined under an Olympus SZx12 stereomicroscope and an Olympus BX50 microscope and identified by employing the most recent literature on Syllidae (e.g. Nygren 2004, San Martín 2003, 2005, San Martín and Hutchings 2006).\n",

      "The world is filled with nature watchers, from trampers to hunters, birders to beach-combers, and pros to school kids. Many of us keep notes of what we find. What if all those observations could be shared online? You might learn about the butterflies that live in your neighbourhood, or discover someone who knows all about the plants in your favourite reserve. For a long time, everyone's notes have been scattered in notebooks, private spreadsheets and dusty library shelves. As a society, we have seen a lot but collectively we remain blind to most changes in our biodiversity. If enough people record their observations on NatureWatch NZ, we can change all this. We can build a living record of life in New Zealand that scientists and environmental managers can use to monitor changes in biodiversity, and that anyone can use to learn more about New Zealand's amazing natural history.\n",
      "Only \"research-quality\" observations are used in this data set - that is observations that have their species identification peer-reviewed by at least one independent source. All biodiversity observations are available at http://naturewatch.org.nz/.\n",
      "NatureWatch NZ is run by the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust, a charitable trust dedicated to bio-recording. Our lofty aims are: (1) To increase knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of New Zealand's natural history.(2) To engage and assist New Zealanders in observing and recording biological information.(3)To develop and support online tools to assist individuals and groups to record, view, share and use biological information. (4) To collaborate with people and groups interested in bio-recording. (5) To promote and provide secure, open, and ethical sources of biological information for the public.\n",

      "Since November 1995, the CARIACO Ocean Time Series program has been studying the relationship between surface primary production (carbon fixation rates by photosynthesis of planktonic algae), regional hydrography, physical forcing variables (such as the wind), and the settling flux of particulate organic carbon in the Cariaco Basin. This tectonic depression, located on the continental shelf of Venezuela, shows marked seasonal and interannual variation in hydrography and primary production induced in part by the regular migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).\n",
      "The Cariaco Basin hydrography is affected by North-Atlantic gyre-scale processes, including dispersal of Subtropical Underwater and western boundary current variability, cross-equatorial flow of water masses (Wust, 1964; Muller-Karger et al., 1989), wind-driven upwelling compounded by geostrophic circulation (Richards, 1975; Muller-Karger and Aparicio-Castro, 1994i), ventilation forced by Caribbean Sea eddies (Astor et al., 2003), and river discharge (Yarincik et al., 2000; Lorenzoni, et al. 2009). Due to its restricted circulation and high primary production, the basin is anoxic below ~250 m (Muller-Karger et al., 2001; 2010). In the late 1990's and early 2000's, CARIACO observations measured annual primary production rates of more than 500 gC/m²y, of which over 15-20% was generated by events lasting one month or less. Since 2004 there has been a decrease in primary production rates (annual averages of less than 400 gC/m²y). Still, the annual primary production rates in the Cariaco Basin are comparable to rates estimated using time series observations for Monterey Bay (460 gC/m² y; Chavez, 1996), and higher than rates estimated for Georges Bank, the New York Shelf, and the Oregon Shelf (380, 300, and 190 gC/m² y, respectively; Walsh, 1988). Primary production and vertical particulate organic matter fluxes in the Cariaco Basin are higher than those observed at the oligotrophic BATS and HOT locations (Karl et al., 2001; Steinberg et al., 2001; Thunell et al., 2007). The Basin also experiences sedimentological events caused by earthquakes (Thunell et al., 1999; Lorenzoni et al., 2012) and coastal flooding (Percy et al., 2008; Lorenzoni et al., 2009). All of these phenomena can influence the sediments.\n",

      "The Terra Nova Expedition, officially the British Antarctic Expedition, was led by Robert Falcon Scott with the primary objective of scientific experiments, observations and gathering of specimens and the secondary objective of being the first to reach the geographical South Pole. The Terra Nova Expedition, named after its supply ship, was a private venture, financed by public contributions augmented by a government grant. It had further backing from the Admiralty, which released experienced seamen to the expedition, and from the Royal Geographical Society. As well as its polar attempt, the expedition carried out a comprehensive scientific programme. The biologist in charge of operations on the ship was Mr. D. G. Lillie, M.A., to whose skill and energy the large and valuable marine collections are mainly due. On the outward and homeward voyages from England to New Zealand fine-meshed tow-nets were put overboard whenever possible, and seventy plankton samples were obtained; in addition two hauls were made with the trawl, one near the Falklands, at a depth of 125 fathoms, and one off Rio de Janeiro, at a depth of 40 fathoms. The winter cruise (July 10th to October 10th, 1911) round the Three Kings Islands and to the north of New Zealand produced biological results of great importance; eighty plankton samples were obtained, and the seven hauls made with trawl and dredge at depths of 15 to 300 fathoms revealed a bottom-fauna of extraordinary variety, including a great number of forms new to science. Between New Zealand and McMurdo Sound one hundred and thirty-five samples of plankton and fifty of muds and oozes were obtained; in the Ross Sea and in McMurdo Sound fifteen rich hauls with the trawl, at depths of 40 to 300 fathoms, produced a collection which has added greatly to our knowledge of the Antarctic marine fauna.\n",

      "AusCPR: Phytoplankton Abundance The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project of CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The phytoplankton abundance data are analysed as per Richardson et al 2006. It is advised that anyone using the data should first read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the CMAR laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII). Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the IMOS data portal: http://imos.aodn.org.au/webportal/ For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006.

In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is an integrated water sample collected with niskin bottles at 10m depth intervals and preserved in lugols solution. The depth of the sample varies at each station. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition / abundance (cells/l) 2. Biovolume (um3/L).

The basis for this work is the nearshore benthic habitats maps (less than 100 ft depth) created by NOAAs Biogeography Program in 2001 and NOS bathymetry models. Using ArcView GIS software, the digitized habitat maps are stratified. Smapling sites are randomly selected within these strata to ensure coverage of the entire study region and not just a particular reef or seagrass area. At each site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and benthic composition information is then quantified following standardized protocols. By relating the data collected in the field back to the habitat maps and bathymetric models, BT is able to model and map species level and community level information. This dataset contains the benthic composition and monitoring data from La Parguera, Puerto Rico.\n",

Because molluscan taxonomy is in a continual state of flux, and because our understanding of what species occur in Tasmania is advancing all the time, a paper publication on this subject rapidly becomes outdated as new species are discovered, new names and taxonomic relationships are introduced and old ones invalidated.\n",

Using ArcView GIS software, the digitized habitat maps are stratified. Smapling sites are randomly selected within these strata to ensure coverage of the entire study region and not just a particular reef or seagrass area. At each site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and benthic composition information is then quantified following standardized protocols.

      "When the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center established the Coral Reef Ecosystems Division (CRED) in 2001, the Center initiated a program to extend habitat mapping in the U.S. Pacific Islands into deeper water that cannot be readily mapped using satellite and aerial techniques. Since that time NOAA Fisheries has led the effort to map these deeper reefs using ship-based acoustic mapping systems, coupled with video and still-camera observations. These sonar and optical data are combined with the IKONOS-based data products and oceanographic information to provide integrated products that describe the benthic habitats of the Pacific Islands.\n",

Samples were collected for phytoplankton profiles and phytotoxin analysis. Associated physicochemical and optical sensing data were collected concurrently to monitor the occurrence of harmful algae blooms. Harmful species responsible for the production of PSP (paralytic shellfish poisoning), DSP (diarrhetic shellfish poisoning), ASP (amnesic shellfish poisoning) and spirolides were enumerated and correlated with toxin concentrations. Clonal isolates were established from net tow samples that contained toxic species. Only the pipe sample phytoplankton profile data is included in this data set.\n",

      "The growth rate of marine biodiversity knowledge among Indian Ocean countries is not uniform, which is due to the lack and asymmetric growth of human, institutional, and technical capabilities. Biodiversity data in the Middle East marine environments (the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman, and the Persian Gulf) are scarce and are generally focused on larger taxa, while groups like sponges, ctenophores, octocorals, polychaetes, and tunicates are poorly known. On the other hand, most of the species diversity information of the region came from coral reef ecosystems, especially from the Red Sea. High maritime activities in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman as the major waterways for oil and gas transport and the lack of a documented database on total taxa diversity require greater attention for the biodiversity of these environments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to extract, standardize, and evaluate these biodiversity data. To fill a part of the gap, the Iranian National Institute for Oceanography and Atmospheric Science (INIOAS) was officially selected as a regional OBIS node in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman (PEGO-OBIS) Then, a project (project grant number: 392-011-05) was conducted entitled Gathering, standardization/digitization and interpretation of existing biological data of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman based on OBIS scheme.The presence Cnidarian occurrence data is part of the above project\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "In order to establish a baseline map of cetaceans and other pelagic megafauna across the French EEZ, the French agency for marine protected areas (AAMP) decided to conduct a series of surveys allowing hotspots of abundance and diversity to be identified and a future monitoring scheme to be established. A dedicated aerial survey methodology, following standard protocols, was preferred to ship surveys. The general design corresponds to published protocols prepared for small cetaceans, but data for other marine mammals (large whales, sirenians), seabirds, sea-turtles, large teleosts and large elasmobranchs) are collected as well. Data collected include species, group size, angle to survey track for cetaceans located within 500m on both sides of survey track, allowing line transect data analyses. For seabirds all encounters located within 200m on both sides of survey track are recorded for strip-transect analysis. Covariates collected on board include sea-state, turbidity, glare and cloud coverage. The study areas include all sectors of the French EEZ: North-East Atlantic, the tropical Atlantic (French Caribbean and Guiana), Indian (Reunion Island, Mayotte and the Scattered Islands) and south Pacific oceans (French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna). \n",
      "These surveys follow the general SCANS methodology (Hiby and Lovell, 1998) adapted to aircrafts. A zigzag track layout is used and transects are sampled at a target altitude of 180 m and ground speed of 90 nm.h-1 (167 km.h-1). Survey platforms are high-wing, double-engine aircrafts fitted with bubble windows; a Partenavia P68 was used in 2008 in the Atlantic and two Britten Norman BN-2 in 2009-10 in the southwest Indian Ocean. \n",
      "Survey crew typically consists in two trained observers observing with naked eyes and a flight leader in charge of data collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "In order to establish a baseline map of cetaceans and other pelagic megafauna across the French EEZ, it was decided to conduct a series of surveys from 2008 onwards following a standardized methodology that would allow comparisons within and between regions as well as temporally, for the sake of the identification of hotspots of abundance and diversity and the establishment of a future monitoring scheme. These surveys are named the REMMOA and SAMM surveys for REcensement des Mammifères marins et autre Mégafaune pélagique par Observation Aérienne (Census of marine mammals and other pelagic megafauna by aerial survey) and Suivi Aérien de la Megafaune Marine (Aerial survey for marine megafauna). Additionally, considering the fragmented nature of the French EEZ, notably compared to the spatial scale that is relevant for the species of interest, the implementation of these surveys at regional scale by collaboration with neighboring countries was encouraged.\n",

      "In Antarctic waters, the superfamily Lysianassoidea is one of the most important amphipod groups both in terms of species number and abundance. Dominant members of this superfamily are species of the orchomenid complex, found throughout the Southern Ocean. This study presents the first molecular phylogenetic analysis based on a representative subset of the Antarctic species belonging to different orchomenid genera and hence provides a framework for a systematic revision of these taxa. The current classification of the orchomenid genera is mainly based on mouthpart morphology. The validity of these morphological characters was assessed by resolving phylogenetic relationships using nuclear 28S rRNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I sequences. The molecular data rejected most of the previously proposed taxonomic subdivisions within this complex. The genera Abyssorchomene and Orchomenella as well as the subgenus Orchomenopsis appeared to be non-monophyletic. This implies that the supposed diagnostic characters are likely a result of convergent evolution. Further, our results indicated the necessity of a revision of the family-level systematics.\n",

Ob Cruise I-II- March-May 1956, cruise II -January-March 1957.The stations of cruise III presented in these protocols are sampled in March 1958. The aim of zooplankton studies from the Ob cruises was the investigation of its composition, abundance and quantitative distribution in Antarctic. The material was sampled with closing vertical hauls of a Juday net ( mouth opening 0,1m2,and 176 µm mesh gause) within the upper 0-500m layer. The sampled layers were usually the next: 0-10, 10-25 (or 0-25), 25-50, 50-100, 100-200 and 200-500 m. The length of lowered wire and the closing depth depended on the angle. Unfortunately a lot of samples got broken during the storms, so the obtained results are not fully complete. The samples processing included identification and counting of plankters. All largerer organisms (&gt;3-5 mm) were enumerated in a total sample. Small organisms were counted in a subsample of ½ -1/10 of the total sample volume, according of the standard methods used at the Plankton Laboratory of the Institute of Oceanology. The sampling was fulfilled in the I cruise by Dr. M.E.Vinogradov and Dr. K.A. Brodski, in the II cruise by Dr. K V. Beklemishev and V.S. Korotkevich and in the III cruise by Dr. K.A. Brodski and A.G. Naumov. The processing of all samples was carried by N.M. Voronina.

R.V.ACADEMIC KURCHATOV, cruise 11, October 1971-January 1972. The main task of this cruise was to obtain a general characteristic of mesoplankton species composition and abundance and its changes in space and time. The samples were usually collected by vertical hauls of closing Juday type nets with mouth opening 0,1 m2 and 180 µm mesh gause. But at station 909 an oceanic modification of this net was used (JOM mouth opening 0,5 m2). The following layers were usually sampled: 0-50, 50-100, 100-200,200-300, 300-400,400-500 and 500-1000 m. In the second part of the cruise the layer 1000-1500 was additionally sampled. The length of lowered wire and the closing depth depended on the angle. The sample processing included identification and counting of Copepoda Calanioida species. . In addition within the upper 100 m all other mesoplankton groups or species and copepods nauplia were counted. All larger organisms (&gt;3-5 mm) were enumerated in a total sample. Smaller organisms were counted totally or in a subsample of ½ -1/10 of the sample volume, according of the standard methods used at the Plankton Laboratory of the Institute of Oceanology. The sampling was carried out by Dr. N.M. Voronina, Dr. Y.A. Rudyakov, Dr. B. Vilenkin and an assistant. The treatment of samples was handled by N.M. Voronina. In total, 225 samples from 31 stations are collected and analyzed. Among them are 63 samples that were collected at station 909 during diurnal investigations, where 9 series in the depths between 0-600 m are sampled. ( NB. It seems that the absence of Neocalanus tonsus on St. 932 is a mistake). RV DMITRY MENDELEEV, cruise 43, 1989 The tasks of plankton studies in this cruise were: 1) to observe the time changes in the age composition and vertical distribution of main copepod species and 2) to obtain a general comparative characteristic of importance of different taxonomic groups in mesoplankton. The samples were collected mainly with Juday net, with a mouth opening diameter of 0,1 m2 or with JOM net, 0,5 m2 mouth opening at several stations. In both cases, the gause was 180 µm. The series of vertical hauls were done in daytime from depths from 0 to 1500 m. The surveyed layers were usually the next: 1500-1000, 1000-1500,500-200 and 25-0 m; between the last they depended on the hydrographic structure of the water. Sampling was conducted using an electronic closing system (Flint at all, 1978). It was done by Dr. A.S.Fedotov and engineer A.S. Malishev. The laboratory analyses were done by Dr. N.M. Voronina right during the cruise. They included counting and identification of organisms. Depended of plankton quantity the samples were counted totally or a subsample ½ -1/5 of it was taken. In total 65 samples from 8 stations were collected and handled. R.V.ACADEMIC IOFFE, cruise 6, 1992. The tasks of plankton studies in this cruise were: 1) the comparison of species composition in different modifications of Antarctic surface waters, 2) the observation of the dependence of vertical distribution of plankton organisms on the hydrophysical structure of the water and 3) the consideration the influence of salps on the copepod populations. The samples were collected with vertical hauls of a Juday net, with a mouth opening diameter of 0,1 m2 , and a mesh size of 180µm. The series of hauls were done in daytime from depths from 0 to 1500 m. The catched layers were usually the next: 1500-1000, 1000-1500, 500-200 and 25-0 m; between the last they depended on the hydrophysic structure of the water. Sampling was conducted using an electronic closing system (Flint at all, 1978). It was carried out by Dr. A.F.Sazhin and engineer S.N.Sedelnicov. The laboratory analyses were carried by Dr. N.M. Voronina during the cruise. They included counting and identification of organisms. Only a selected set of species were considered. They were the most abundant Antarctic copepods, euphausiids and salps. After this, all findings of subantarctic copepods were registred. Depended of plankton quantity the samples were counted totally or a subsample ½ -1/5 of it was taken. In total 65 samples from 8 stations were collected and treated.\n",

      "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN Nova Scotia Power project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The first of three installations of in-stream tidal power infrastructure in the Minas Passage of the inner Bay of Fundy was deployed in November 2009. Little is known about the impact of turbine operation on the survival and behaviour of fishes moving through the Passage. To address the potential for fish-turbine interactions near the deployed OpenHydro turbine, we are using animal tracking technology developed by Vemco of Halifax, Nova Scotia, to track fish movement, behaviour and environmental preferences over a scale of kilometres. This project will provide real in-situ measurements of the direction, depth and velocity of tagged fishes moving through the Passage. Three species of concern will be tagged during 2010: Atlantic sturgeon, striped bass and American eels. Fishes tagged with acoustic transmitting tags will broadcast unique signals that will be archived by an array of acoustic hydrophone receivers in the Minas Passage. A dense array of receivers located at the OpenHydro turbine site will provide fine scale information on movements and behaviour of fish in relation to an operating tidal turbine. In addition a line of receivers spanning the Passage, placed in co-operation with OTN and Acadia University, will provide information on the spatial and temporal distribution and movement of fish in the Passage. To enhance the assessment of the risk to fishes of direct contact with the turbine, in situ data will be used to refine mathematical hydrodynamic models that predict how objects like fish move in the Passage and potentially interact with turbine infrastructure. This information will be valuable in identifying mitigation measures that may be taken to lessen any negative effects of in-stream turbine infrastructure on fish behaviour and survival.\n",

Benfield (Department of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences, Louisiana State University) and William M. Graham (Dauphin Island Sea Lab and University of South Alabama).\n",
      "Four individuals of the large scyphozoan jellyfish Stygiomedusa gigantea were observed in the northern Gulf of Mexico over 2005 – 2009 by industrial remotely operated vehicles as part of the SERPENT Project. One of these observations included the symbiotic Bythitid fish Thalassobathia pelagica. Prior to these observations, neither S. gigantea nor T. pelagica had been observed in, or collected from the Gulf of Mexico. In order to summarize the available information on S. gigantea, we located 110 observations obtained over 110 years (1899 – 2009) representing 118 individual specimens of this species from around the world. The resulting dataset confirms that this species is cosmopolitan occurring with records from all Oceans except the Arctic. While the depth range of the four Gulf of Mexico specimens was bathypelagic, there appears to be a pattern of S. gigantea occurring in mesopelagic and epipelagic depth zones at high latitudes, particularly in the Southern Ocean and mesopelagic and bathypelagic depths at mid- and low-latitudes. This pattern may be related to the meridional vertical distribution of temperature or perhaps avoidance of light levels that could degrade porphyrin pigments. There was no evidence that this species migrates vertically. Two of the individuals in the Gulf of Mexico appeared to be actively clinging to subsea structures and we speculate that this is a consequence of its normal mode of feeding which may entail using its large oral lobes to hold on to, and trap prey.\n",

Analyses are based upon (1) original material taken during eight cruises in the Atlantic Ocean (a total of 5861 individuals) and (2) available literature data from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Vent shrimps have two patterns of the species ranges: local (single vent site) and regional (three - six vent sites). Pacific species ranges are mainly of the local type and the Atlantic species ranges are of the regional type. The regional type of species ranges may be associated with channels providing easy larval dispersal (rift valleys, trenches), while the local type is characteristic for other areas. Specialization of a shrimp genus to extreme vent habitats leads to two effects: (1) an increase in the number of vent fields inhabited by the genus and (2) a decrease of species number within the genus.\n",

The goals were to determine the distribution of harmful phytoplankton, to monitor for novel toxins and identify their planktonic origin, to investigate methods for the early detection of toxic algal blooms and to evaluate and improve monitoring strategies by developing and implementing new technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phytoplankton samples were collected at regular intervals at two Nova Scotian aquaculture sites at Grave’s Shoal (1996-1998) and Ship Harbour (1998-2006). Samples were collected for phytoplankton profiles and phytotoxin analysis. Associated physicochemical and optical sensing data were collected concurrently to monitor the occurrence of harmful algae blooms. Harmful species responsible for the production of PSP (paralytic shellfish poisoning), DSP (diarrhetic shellfish poisoning), ASP (amnesic shellfish poisoning) and spirolides were enumerated and correlated with toxin concentrations. Clonal isolates were established from net tow samples that contained toxic species. Only the pipe sample phytoplankton profile data is included in this data set.\n",

      "Shorekeepers is a rigorous monitoring methodology. The key to getting reliable scientific data is to use standard survey methods so that everyone is collecting data in the same way over time at all sites. A monitoring guide developed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada presents an intertidal surveying methodology. The method is presented in a logical step-by-step manner starting from selecting a study area through each type of measurement to entering the field data into the database, and finally, reporting the results. After a few days of training in habitat mapping and species identification, community members can use these step-by-step protocols to routinely monitor their site of interest or concern. The challenge is to distinguish natural changes from human-induced ones over time. Nevertheless, the resulting data will help us all to gain a better understanding of these dynamic ecosystems, and to make wiser decisions about coastal development and marine conservation.\n",

Phytoplankton samples were collected at 31 stations along a 145-km transect where the variability of salinity, temperature, turbidity and nutrient concentrations reflected a broad range of environmental factors that regulate phytoplankton growth and abundance (map of sampling locations is available on the project website at: https://sfbay.wr.usgs.gov/access/wqdata/overview/wherewhen/stnmap.html). Whole water samples were preserved with acid Lugol’s solution, and 2 to 50 ml aliquots were settled in chambers for 6 to 24 hours (Utermöhl 1958). Phytoplankton cells were then counted and identified using a phase-contrast inverted microscope at 125x magnification, all cells greater than 30 μm diameter were enumerated. Cells smaller than 30 μm were counted at 1250x magnification; following the APHA (1989) strip count method, at least 100 cells of the most numerous taxon were counted. Cell volumes were estimated from measured linear dimensions and geometric formulas that varied with cell shapes. Phytoplankton samples representing 923 distinct date, station and depths were included. The 16,442 entries in this dataset include 609 different taxa within 11 functional groups. Diatoms dominated the total biovolume contributed by each functional group (77%) followed by dinoflagellates (14%) and cryptophytes (4.5%). The top 5 species contributing to the summed biovolume in all samples were: Thalassiosira punctigera, Chaetoceros socialis, Ditylum brightwellii, Thalassiosira rotula and Noctiluca scintillans. By frequency of occurrence, the top 5 species were: Teleaulax amphioxeia, Nannochloropsis spp., Plagioselmis prolonga var. nordica, Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira eccentrica.\n",

      "The phylogenetic relationships of 14 species of the Antarctic amphipod families Epimeriidae and Iphimediidae were investigated using 553 bp of the gene for the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 98 morphological characters. Both families are dominant members of the Antarctic benthic amphipod community. In contrast to previous studies, our molecular and morphological data suggest that the families Epimeriidae and Iphimediidae may not be sister taxa. Our study suggests that Iphimediidae are more closely related to Eusirus (Eusiridae) than to Epimeria (Epimeriidae). Phylogenetic analyses based on maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) indicate that the genera Iphimediella and Gnathiphimedia are not monophyletic.\n",

Hydrothermal vent fauna are reliant upon the productivity associated with vent flow and require special adaptations in order to tolerate the variety of challenges posed by potentially toxic chemicals and a wide range of temperatures. Thus, characterizing the habitats of the fauna is a criti.cal first step in understanding their ecology, but can be quite difficult and time consuming in these complex, remote, and relatively inaccessible environments.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project was designed to develop and promote the application of acoustic tagging technology to study the life history of Pacific salmon and other species migrating along the continental shelf of western North America. POST envisioned the eventual creation of a permanent continental-scale telemetry system, however, during its existence more limited pilot-scale arrays were deployed, primarily concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. These included several acoustic receiver curtains between Vancouver Island and the mainland, creating an excellent means by which to monitor coastal marine animal migrations, especially by juvenile salmonids (smolts) migrating to sea (see projects QCS, JDF and NSOG). In addition to arrays on the continental shelf, POST equipment was deployed upstream and in the estuaries of several major salmon-producing rivers.  POST arrays, and POST data, were incorporated into the OTN in 2012. The integration of these arrays, their equipment and the associated animal tagging projects into OTN's global network allowed for international, widespread monitoring of important species within the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Tracking data generated from the POST arrays can be applied to the development of fishery management policies aimed at the sustainable harvest of resources, and to the understanding and conservation of other marine and diadromous species. Additional details about specific tracking projects which were originally a part of POST are only available by contacting the associated researcher.\n",

      "Interest in the deep seas has increased dramatically in the last decade, due to the potential presence of natural resources. Although Colombia holds a large submerged territory, knowledge of the seabed and its biodiversity beyond a depth of 1000 meters is very limited. During 2015-2017, Anadarko Colombia Company (ACC) carried out hydrocarbon exploratory activities in the Southern Colombian Caribbean, at depths between 375 m and 2500 m.  As an opportunistic result from these activities, several organisms from different phyla were spotted in ROV and towed camera surveys. We analysed a total of 9h 9min 26sec of video and 5066 photographs, looking for benthic and pelagic megafauna. The images were separated by Phylum and Class, and the cnidarians were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. The data presented here corresponds to 108 occurrences of deep-sea cnidarians and one ctenophore. This is the first of a series of datasets reporting visual confirmations on the occurrences of deep-sea organisms in the Colombian Caribbean.\n",

There are large gaps in ecological knowledge of gulper sharks which limit the effective design of area closures (e.g. optimising sizes and numbers) and assessment of their performance. The survey aimed to fill these gaps do this by characterising the habitats and ecosystem processes in 200-700 m depths that sustain key species, and commencing a process to determine the relevant aspects of species ecology. Primarily this will be (1) to measure the movement of fish within and to/ from a large closed area in the GAB with a tagging program, and (2) estimate the abundance of selected species in relation to habitat features (substructure within submarine canyons, escarpments and rocky banks, and adjacent water column features) with two independent, non-extractive photographic methods.

The islands and atolls (Ducie, Henderson, Oeno, and Pitcairn) are situated in the central South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and South America. We surveyed algae, corals, mobile invertebrates, and fishes at 97 sites between 5 and 30 m depth, and found 51 new records for algae, 23 for corals, and 15 for fishes. The structure of the ecological communities was correlated with age, isolation, and geomorphology of the four islands. Coral and algal assemblages were significantly different among islands with Ducie having the highest coral cover (56%) and Pitcairn dominated by erect macroalgae (42%). Fish biomass was dominated by top predators at Ducie (62% of total fish biomass) and at Henderson (35%). Herbivorous fishes dominated at Pitcairn, while Oeno showed a balanced fish trophic structure. We found high levels of regional endemism in the fish assemblages across the islands (45%), with the highest level observed at Ducie (56% by number). We conducted the first surveys of the deep habitats around the Pitcairn Islands using drop-cameras at 21 sites from depths of 78 to 1,585 m. We observed 57 fish species from the drop-cams, including rare species such as the false catshark (Pseudotriakis microdon) and several new undescribed species. In addition, we made observations of typically shallow reef sharks and other reef fishes at depths down to 300 m. Our findings highlight the uniqueness and high biodiversity value of the Pitcairn Islands as one of the least impacted in the Pacific, and suggest the need for immediate protection.\n",

      "Deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities contain a high proportion of endemic species, particularly at higher taxonomic levels. This endemism reflects the high degree of specialization required to succeed in one of Earth's most extreme environments. The brachyuran crab family Bythograeidae Williams, 1980 (superfamily Bythograeoidea) is among the most ubiquitous and abundant group of macroinvertebrates to have colonized the deep-sea hydrothermal vents worldwide. It is also the only group within the diverse infraorder Brachyura (which contains 7000 valid species and subspecies in 93 families) that is endemic to this extreme environment. This is remarkable, as only one other brachyuran species from a very distant family is endemic to hydrothermal vents, but from shallow waters (i.e., Xenograpsus testudinatus in Xenograpsidae); and just a handful of opportunistic brachyuran species have been observed at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Understanding the evolution of this important deep-sea hydrothermal vent taxon requires knowledge on the phylogenetic relationships among its members.\n",
      "As presently diagnosed, the family Bythograeidae consists of six genera and fourteen described species. The family is most diverse at the eastern Pacific vent systems (the East Pacific Rise, Galapagos Rift, and the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge), where it is represented by eight species belonging to three endemic genera: Cyanagraea praedator; Allograea tomentosa; Bythograea thermydron; Bythograea microps; Bythograea laubieri; Bythograea vrijenhoeki; Bythograea intermedia; and Bythograea galapagensis (although the last two are very likely a synonymy). The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is inhabited by Segonzacia mesatlantica. The Western Pacific back-arc basins are inhabited by Austinograea williamsi, Austinograea alayseae, Gandalfus puia, and Gandalfus yunohana. In addition, an undescribed Austinograea species (A. affinity williamsi) is suspected in the Western Pacific Lau back-arc basin. Finally, Austinograea rodriguezensis inhabits the Central Indian Ridge. The northeastern Pacific ridges (Explorer, Juan de Fuca, and Gorda) are the only major spreading centers that lack bythograeids.

      "Information regarding the molluscs in this dataset is based on the epibenthic sledge (EBS) samples collected during the cruise BIOPEARL II / JR179 RRS James Clark Ross in the austral summer 2008. A total of 34 epibenthic sledge deployments have been performed at five locations in the Amundsen Sea at Pine Island Bay (PIB) and the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) at depths ranging from 476 to 3501m. This presents a unique and important collection for the Antarctic benthic biodiversity assessment as the Amundsen Sea remains one of the least known regions in Antarctica. Indeed the work presented in this dataset is based on the first benthic samples collected with an EBS in the Amundsen Sea. However we assume that the data represented are an underestimation of the real fauna present in the Amundsen Sea. In total 9261 specimens belonging to 6 classes 55 families and 97 morphospecies were collected. The species richness per station varied between 6 and 43. Gastropoda were most species rich (50 species) followed by Bivalvia (37), Aplacophora (5), Scaphopoda (3) and one from each of Polyplacophora and Monoplacophora.\n",

      "Each year, three observers take place on board the vessel “Thalassa” to record sightings of seabirds, marine mammals, large fish and fishing boats, from dawn to dusk. Following distance sampling methods, visual censuses are made by two observers (while the third observer is resting) from the upper platform of the boat (min. 14m above the sea level). They are placed on each side of the deck, looking ahead for marine predator with an angle of 180°. For each sighting, the species and the number of individuals are recorded, as well as the behaviour, distance and angle (upon request).\n",

Interactions between prey and predators are complex in marine ecosystems, which are submitted to strong spatio-temporal variations. Thanks to ecosystem-based surveys, observed distributions and densities of marine predators can be related to the occurrence of their prey, providing to scientists and managers a better understanding of the marine ecosystems structure.\n",

A total of 18 epibenthic dredge deployments/samplings have been performed at four diffrent locations at depths ranging from 84 to 515m by using a \"Rauschert\" dredge with a mesh size of 500μm. In total 8,359 specimens have been collected belonging to 161 species and corresponding to 505 species distributional records. Of these, in order of abundance, 5,965 specimens were Gastropoda (accounting for 113 species), 1,323 were Bivalvia (accounting for 36 species), 949 were Aplacophora (accounting for 7 species), 74 specimens were Scaphopoda (3 species), 38 were Monoplacophora (1 species) and, finally, 10 specimens were Polyplacophora (1 species). This data set represent the first large-scale survey of benthic micromolluscs for the area and provides important information about the distribution of several species which have been seldom or never recorded before in the Ross Sea. All vouchers are permanently stored at the Italian National Antarctic Museum (MNA), Section of Genoa, enabling future comparison and crosschecking. This material is also currently under study, from a molecular point of view, by the barcoding project \"BAMBi\" (PNRA 2010/A1.10).\n",

The naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, one of the founders of the Theory of Evolution, was the first to really establish the collection of echinoderms at the Paris Museum. There are both dry and alcohol-preserved lots. Some sea cucumber specimens are preserved as microscopic preparations on slides. The number of lots is estimated at 500,000, of which 0.4% are types. Echinoderms have been collected in all oceans, at all latitudes. The largest numbers of specimens were collected relatively recently in the Indo-West Pacific. Echinoderms live exclusively in marine waters and at all depths. For 25 years intensive research programs have permitted huge collections to be obtained, especially from the Indo-Pacific and Antarctic regions. Most of the data entered so far are from these regions.\n",

Simultaneously, IMOS ATF developed a centralised national database (https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au/) to encourage collaborative research across the user community and provide unprecedented opportunities to quantify individual behaviour across a broad range of taxa. Here we present the database and quality control procedures developed to collate 48.5 million valid detections from 1891 receiving stations. This dataset consists of detection data for 3523 tags deployed on 117 species (fish, sharks, rays, reptiles, and mammals), with distances travelled ranging from a few to thousands of kilometres. This dataset of acoustic detections constitutes a valuable resource facilitating meta-analysis of animal movement, distributions, and habitat use, and is important for relating species distribution shifts with environmental covariates.\n",

      "Larval fishes are a useful metric of marine ecosystem state and change, as well as species-specific patterns in phenology. The high level of taxonomic expertise required to identify larval fishes to species level, and the considerable effort required to collect them, make these data extremely valuable. Here we collate 3178 samples of larval fishes, from 12 research projects from 1983 to November 2016, from temperate and subtropical Australian waters.

The dataset was created for the Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEW) for use in profiling of the North Marine Region during the development of a marine bioregional plan for the region. Data from all voyages are in a single set of tables and in the same structure and measurement units. The aim of the dataset is to provide convenient access to the data from the source datasets, which were stored in various data structures in various locations. Although the data are presented in uniform measurement units of counts and weights per unit area, data from different samples cannot be assumed to be comparable. In particular, the catchability of a species varies among types of sampling gears. Even samples from a given gear type on a given voyage may not all be comparable to one another. For example, gear may be altered during a voyage (e.g. multiple codend mesh sizes may be tried) and fish trawls are occasionally aimed at fish visible on the echo sounder. The data should therefore be analysed no more than semi-quantitatively. Assumptions on the comparability of samples -- even from a single voyage and gear type -- should be based on reference to the voyage reports.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project was designed to develop and promote the application of acoustic tagging technology to study the life history of Pacific salmon and other species migrating along the continental shelf of western North America. POST envisioned the eventual creation of a permanent continental-scale telemetry system, however, during its existence more limited pilot-scale arrays were deployed, primarily concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. These included several acoustic receiver curtains between Vancouver Island and the mainland, creating an excellent means by which to monitor coastal marine animal migrations, especially by juvenile salmonids (smolts) migrating to sea (see projects QCS, JDF and NSOG). In addition to arrays on the continental shelf, POST equipment was deployed upstream and in the estuaries of several major salmon-producing rivers.  POST arrays, and POST data, were incorporated into the OTN in 2012. The integration of these arrays, their equipment and the associated animal tagging projects into OTN's global network allowed for international, widespread monitoring of important species within the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Tracking data generated from the POST arrays can be applied to the development of fishery management policies aimed at the sustainable harvest of resources, and to the understanding and conservation of other marine and diadromous species. Additional details about specific tracking projects which were originally a part of POST are only available by contacting the associated researcher.\n",

      "In support of New York State's commitment to incorporating offshore wind into its energy portfolio, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) embarked on a multi-year ultrahigh-resolution aerial digital survey of marine resources in a 12,650 square nautical mile offshore planning area (OPA) in 2016. The OPA encompasses the waters of the New York Bight from Long Island southeast to the continental shelf break. Surveys are conducted on a quarterly basis, timed to coincide with periods of abundance of avian and marine species vulnerable to impacts from offshore wind activities. This report summarizes the results of the first two surveys conducted in July–August and November 2016. Each survey collected images covering at least 7% of the OPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the more than 700,000 images collected within the survey area during these two surveys, 3.8% (27,135 images) contained organisms, including 38 bird, 17 fish, 5 whales, 7 dolphin, 1 seal, and 4 sea turtle species. Some seasonal patterns were evident. During the summer survey, the vast majority of the organisms observed were rays (8,388 images) or birds (1,893 images). During the fall survey, birds predominated (12,352 images). Shearwaters, storm-petrels, and terns were substantially more abundant in the summer while ducks, gannets, gulls and phalaropes were substantially more abundant in the fall. Turtles, sharks, and large bony fishes were all most abundant in the summer, though present in the fall. Number of images with marine mammals was similar in both surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spatial patterns were apparent in some taxonomic groups. A number of species tended to occur in nearshore waters including large gulls and least, royal and Sterna terns. Turtles typically occurred inshore of the 70 m isobath. Audubon's, sooty, and Cory's shearwaters clustered in the northeast corner of the OPA. Whales, Audubon's shearwaters, and black-capped petrels were most common near the shelf break. While sharks exhibited no clear patterns, rays showed some tendency to cluster off the mouth of New York Harbor. Large bony fishes typically occurred in deeper waters.\n",

      "In order to establish a baseline map of cetaceans and other pelagic megafauna across the French EEZ, the French agency for marine protected areas (AAMP) decided to conduct a series of surveys allowing hotspots of abundance and diversity to be identified and a future monitoring scheme to be established. A dedicated aerial survey methodology, following standard protocols, was preferred to ship surveys. The general design corresponds to published protocols prepared for small cetaceans, but data for other marine mammals (large whales, sirenians), seabirds, sea-turtles, large teleosts and large elasmobranchs) are collected as well. Data collected include species, group size, angle to survey track for cetaceans located within 500m on both sides of survey track, allowing line transect data analyses. For seabirds all encounters located within 200m on both sides of survey track are recorded for strip-transect analysis. Covariates collected on board include sea-state, turbidity, glare and cloud coverage. The study areas include all sectors of the French EEZ: North-East Atlantic, the tropical Atlantic (French Caribbean and Guiana), Indian (Reunion Island, Mayotte and the Scattered Islands) and south Pacific oceans (French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna). \n",
      "These surveys follow the general SCANS methodology (Hiby and Lovell, 1998) adapted to aircrafts. A zigzag track layout is used and transects are sampled at a target altitude of 180 m and ground speed of 90 nm.h-1 (167 km.h-1). Survey platforms are high-wing, double-engine aircrafts fitted with bubble windows; a Partenavia P68 was used in 2008 in the Atlantic and two Britten Norman BN-2 in 2009-10 in the southwest Indian Ocean. \n",

These surveys are named the REMMOA and SAMM surveys for REcensement des Mammifères marins et autre Mégafaune pélagique par Observation Aérienne (Census of marine mammals and other pelagic megafauna by aerial survey) and Suivi Aérien de la Megafaune Marine (Aerial survey for marine megafauna).

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The objective is to assess the speed of outmigration, and location and level of mortality in freshwater and coastal areas, for individual smolts from Chilko Lake, a population situated 750 km inland from the ocean and is the highest elevation rearing lake for sockeye salmon in Canada. In spring 2010, 200 2-yr old juveniles were captured as they initiated their smolt outmigration and surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Sentinel acoustic receivers situated near the release site and in the lower Fraser River, and acoustic curtains associated with POST were used to determine travel rates and locales and levels of mortality.  Preliminary results indicate that smolts travelled at ~ 1-2 km/h during the initial sections of their migration through turbulent and clear water environments, and final sections, which were turbid and tidally influenced, of the freshwater migration. But they travelled ~ 5 km/h through the expansive fast flowing sections in between. Diel patterns were evident. On average fish reached the ocean in ~ 8 days with a range of 5-17 days among fish. Survival to reach the estuary is estimated at 20-30% and 15-20% to reach the first POST acoustic curtain situated in Northern Strait of Georgia about 180 km from the Fraser River mouth. We await the downloads of the other POST acoustic curtains to assess survival beyond this first acoustic receiver curtain. Of concern is that at present, POST does not have the funding available to download all of its Canadian curtains (e.g. the Queen Charlotte Strait line) and it is unclear when or if this will happen.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project was designed to develop and promote the application of acoustic tagging technology to study the life history of Pacific salmon and other species migrating along the continental shelf of western North America. POST envisioned the eventual creation of a permanent continental-scale telemetry system, however, during its existence more limited pilot-scale arrays were deployed, primarily concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. These included several acoustic receiver curtains between Vancouver Island and the mainland, creating an excellent means by which to monitor coastal marine animal migrations, especially by juvenile salmonids (smolts) migrating to sea (see projects QCS, JDF and NSOG). In addition to arrays on the continental shelf, POST equipment was deployed upstream and in the estuaries of several major salmon-producing rivers.  POST arrays, and POST data, were incorporated into the OTN in 2012. The integration of these arrays, their equipment and the associated animal tagging projects into OTN's global network allowed for international, widespread monitoring of important species within the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Tracking data generated from the POST arrays can be applied to the development of fishery management policies aimed at the sustainable harvest of resources, and to the understanding and conservation of other marine and diadromous species. Additional details about specific tracking projects which were originally a part of POST are only available by contacting the associated researcher.\n",

      "Regional Population Connectivity, Oceanic Habitat, and Return Migration Revealed by Satellite Tagging of White Sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, at New Zealand Aggregation Sites.\n",
      "A joint NIWA/Department of Conservation (DOC) tagging programme was launched in 2005.  Hi-tech electronic tags are being used to gather information on where the sharks are and when, and to record their depth and the temperature of the surrounding water. Three tag types have been used: popup archival tags, acoustic tags, and dorsal fin tags.\n",
      "Popup tags are implanted in the muscle under the dorsal fin with a tagging pole, and record depth, temperature and location, storing the data for up to a year. They then release themselves from the shark, float to the surface, and transmit summaries of the data to a satellite. If the tags are physically recovered, the high resolution data collected at one minute intervals can be downloaded. Popup tags provide only approximate location data, so they are most useful for tracking long-distance migrations.\n",
      "Acoustic tags send out coded, individually identifiable sound ‘pings’ that can be detected up to a kilometre away by acoustic data loggers. The tag batteries last long enough to monitor the presence of white sharks in the region in the vicinity of a data logger for two years. Acoustic tags provide accurate fine-scale information on sharks at specific locations.\n",
      "Dorsal fin tags bridge the gap between popup and acoustic tags. They provide accurate location information by transmitting to orbiting satellites every time the shark is at the surface and the dorsal fin and the tag’s aerial are exposed to air. Their batteries can last for more than one year, so both fine scale and large scale movement patterns can be recorded. However, dorsal fin tags are more difficult to deploy: the shark has to be caught and restrained while the tag is attached to the dorsal fin. So far, only a few of these tags have been deployed in New Zealand.\n",
      "Since 2005, 44 white sharks have been tagged with popup tags, mainly at the Chatham Islands and Stewart Island. These islands support large colonies of fur seals, which are a major food source for white sharks. Our research has focussed on Stewart Island since 2009. The population there is dominated by males (about 2.2 males for every female). Nearly all of the females are immature, being shorter than the female length at maturity of 4.5 to 5 m. Only about one-third of the males are longer than the male length at maturity of about 3.6 m. This indicates that the white shark aggregations at Stewart Island are not related to mating, and are most likely driven by the abundance of seals for food. Large, mature females are rarely seen anywhere in New Zealand and their distribution, habitat and behaviour are almost completely unknown.\n",
      "Tagging results show that most New Zealand white sharks make annual migrations to tropical waters in winter, travelling as far as 3,300 km away. Sharks have migrated to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the Coral Sea, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Norfolk Island, Fiji and Tonga. They don't cross the equator.\n",
      "Most of the sharks from Stewart Island headed northwest of New Zealand, whereas most Chatham Islands sharks headed north.  However, some sharks from the two tagging locations overlap in the tropics. Surprisingly, we have not detected any direct movement between Stewart and Chatham islands.\n",
      "Some popup tags have remained on the sharks for long enough (up to one year) to reveal that the sharks returned to their tagging locations after their tropical holiday. This has been confirmed by photo-identification work at Stewart Island. Each shark has a unique colour pattern, particularly around the gills and on the tail. Some individuals have been seen at Stewart Island each year for multiple years. This indicates that white sharks have a sophisticated navigation mechanism that enables them to make major direct oceanic migrations, and then return to precisely the spot they left from. We do not know how they achieve this.\n",

Pelagic fish distribution was investigated with acoustic methods (SIMRAD EK-500, double frequency ecosound, of 38 and 120 kHz) and fish was collected with a mid-water trawl at stations with high target strength, mainly within 100 and 500-m depth. Demersal fish were investigated to assess the fishing potential of catches vulnerable to hooks over both hard and soft bottoms on the outer shelf and upper slope – 80% of captures consisted of commercially valuable species.\n",

The basis for this work is the nearshore benthic habitats maps (less than 100 ft depth) created by NOAAs Biogeography Program in 2001 and NOS bathymetry models. Using ArcView GIS software, the digitized habitat maps are stratified. Smapling sites are randomly selected within these strata to ensure coverage of the entire study region and not just a particular reef or seagrass area. At each site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and benthic composition information is then quantified following standardized protocols. By relating the data collected in the field back to the habitat maps and bathymetric models, BT is able to model and map species level and community level information. This dataset contains the fish assessment and monitoring data from La Parguera, Puerto Rico.\n",

Abstract: Objectives are to better understand the ecological function of large marine carnivores in continental-shelf ecosystems, using grey seals as our model species and novel acoustic technology developed for OTN. There are two components: 1) spatial and temporal patterns of prey encounters by a mobile, large marine predator, and 2) predator movements and foraging distribution in relation to fine- and meso- scale seasonal oceanography in eastern Canada. The first study will contribute to science advice on the impact of pinniped predation on the dynamics of prey populations of commercial or conservation importance. The second study seeks to understand the oceanographic features that grey seals may use to condition the way they search the environment for food and in turn predict how climate variability and long-term change may affect upper-trophic level predators and alter their impact on continental shelf ecosystems.\n",

      "In 2012 we conducted an integrated ecological assessment of the marine environment of the Pitcairn Islands, which are four of the most remote islands in the world. The islands and atolls (Ducie, Henderson, Oeno, and Pitcairn) are situated in the central South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and South America. We surveyed algae, corals, mobile invertebrates, and fishes at 97 sites between 5 and 30 m depth, and found 51 new records for algae, 23 for corals, and 15 for fishes. The structure of the ecological communities was correlated with age, isolation, and geomorphology of the four islands. Coral and algal assemblages were significantly different among islands with Ducie having the highest coral cover (56%) and Pitcairn dominated by erect macroalgae (42%). Fish biomass was dominated by top predators at Ducie (62% of total fish biomass) and at Henderson (35%). Herbivorous fishes dominated at Pitcairn, while Oeno showed a balanced fish trophic structure. We found high levels of regional endemism in the fish assemblages across the islands (45%), with the highest level observed at Ducie (56% by number). We conducted the first surveys of the deep habitats around the Pitcairn Islands using drop-cameras at 21 sites from depths of 78 to 1,585 m. We observed 57 fish species from the drop-cams, including rare species such as the false catshark (Pseudotriakis microdon) and several new undescribed species. In addition, we made observations of typically shallow reef sharks and other reef fishes at depths down to 300 m. Our findings highlight the uniqueness and high biodiversity value of the Pitcairn Islands as one of the least impacted in the Pacific, and suggest the need for immediate protection.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: Marine survival rates of many juvenile salmon populations have declined in recent decades. Although several potential causes have been proposed, there has been little conclusive evidence for which factors are responsible or not responsible for these declines. We experimen- tally addressed the hypothesis that exposure of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch or sockeye salmon O. nerka to solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) during freshwater rearing of fry and parr life-history stages increases mortality at the time of smoltification and ocean entry. Juvenile coho and sockeye salmon were reared in outdoor hatchery tanks either exposed to full spectrum sun- light or shielded from UVB radiation by plastic screens for up to 9 mo prior to release. Smolts were tagged with acoustic transmitters and detected with hydrophone receivers during their downriver and early ocean migration. Survival of treatment groups was compared using Cormack-Jolly- Seber and Burnham mark-recapture models. While exposure to UVB resulted in decreased growth of juvenile coho salmon, survivorship during the early marine period was unaffected by the UVB treatment for both populations. This first attempt to experimentally address the hypo - thesis of impaired survival resulting from solar UVB radiation has shown that other factors are more likely responsible for observed declines in salmon marine survival rates.

Beside it, a beach nourishment was conducted at Mariakerke (681243m³) and Middelkerke (968754m³). For the Mariakerke area, we collect biological and sedimentological samples in the impact area and in a control area (Bredene), before as after the suppletion, whereas for Middelkerke only the data after suppletion was part of the study. We monitor the marine ecosystem with a focus on the fauna within the sediment (macrofauna) and on the sediment (hyperbenthos, epi- and demersal fish fauna) in the intertidal zone and subtidal zone. In both studies, the subtidal area is the zone between the low water line and the 6m depth line and the intertdial area is the zone between low and high tide water line.\n",

We have searched archives, contacted researchers, and scanned the primary and grey literature to collate 3,665,221 records of marine phytoplankton species from Australian waters from 1844 to the present. Many of these are small datasets collected for local questions, but combined they provide over 170 years of data on phytoplankton communities in Australian waters. Units and taxonomy have been standardised, obviously erroneous data removed, and all metadata included. We have lodged this dataset with the Australian Ocean Data Network (http://imos.aodn.org.au/), allowing public access. The Australian Phytoplankton Database will be invaluable for global change studies, as it allows analysis of ecological indicators of climate change and eutrophication (e.g., changes in distribution; diatom:dinoflagellate ratios).

      "In support of New York State's commitment to incorporating offshore wind into its energy portfolio, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) embarked on a multi-year ultrahigh-resolution aerial digital survey of marine resources in a 12,650 square nautical mile offshore planning area (OPA) in 2016. The OPA encompasses the waters of the New York Bight from Long Island southeast to the continental shelf break. Surveys are conducted on a quarterly basis, timed to coincide with periods of abundance of avian and marine species vulnerable to impacts from offshore wind activities. This report summarizes the results of the first two surveys conducted in July–August and November 2016. Each survey collected images covering at least 7% of the OPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the more than 700,000 images collected within the survey area during these two surveys, 3.8% (27,135 images) contained organisms, including 38 bird, 17 fish, 5 whales, 7 dolphin, 1 seal, and 4 sea turtle species. Some seasonal patterns were evident. During the summer survey, the vast majority of the organisms observed were rays (8,388 images) or birds (1,893 images). During the fall survey, birds predominated (12,352 images). Shearwaters, storm-petrels, and terns were substantially more abundant in the summer while ducks, gannets, gulls and phalaropes were substantially more abundant in the fall. Turtles, sharks, and large bony fishes were all most abundant in the summer, though present in the fall. Number of images with marine mammals was similar in both surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spatial patterns were apparent in some taxonomic groups. A number of species tended to occur in nearshore waters including large gulls and least, royal and Sterna terns. Turtles typically occurred inshore of the 70 m isobath. Audubon's, sooty, and Cory's shearwaters clustered in the northeast corner of the OPA. Whales, Audubon's shearwaters, and black-capped petrels were most common near the shelf break. While sharks exhibited no clear patterns, rays showed some tendency to cluster off the mouth of New York Harbor. Large bony fishes typically occurred in deeper waters.\n",

      "This dataset comprises the zooplankton abundance estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the Plankton National Reference Station within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the Australian National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.\n",

      "Sizing Ocean Giants Records: 429\n",
      "What are the greatest sizes that the largest marine megafauna obtain? This is a simple question with a difficult and complex answer. Many of the largest-sized species occur in the world’s oceans. For many of these, rarity, remoteness, and quite simply the logistics of measuring these giants has made obtaining accurate size measurements difficult. Inaccurate reports of maximum sizes run rampant through the scientific literature and popular media. Moreover, how intraspecific variation in the body sizes of these animals relates to sex, population structure, the environment, and interactions with humans remains underappreciated. Here, we review and analyze body size for 25 ocean giants ranging across the animal kingdom. For each taxon we document body size for the largest known marine species of several clades. We also analyze intraspecific variation and identify the largest known individuals for each species. Where data allows, we analyze spatial and temporal intraspecific size variation. We also provide allometric scaling equations between different size measurements as resources to other researchers. In some cases, the lack of data prevents us from fully examining these topics and instead we specifically highlight these deficiencies and the barriers that exist for data collection. Overall, we found considerable variability in intraspecific size distributions from strongly left- to strongly right-skewed. We provide several allometric equations that allow for estimation of total lengths and weights from more easily obtained measurements. In several cases, we also quantify considerable geographic variation and decreases in size likely attributed to humans.\n",

      "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN Raby Coho Salmon Tagging project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: In August 2012, we conducted a pilot study in the Juan de Fuca strait where we tagged 50 wild adult coho salmon with VEMCO V8 acoustic transmitters (PhD student Raby, technicians Stamplecoskie, Hills, Thompson). This effectively is the first work anywhere on tracking the homeward migration of coho salmon in the marine environment. The fish we tagged were biopsied for DNA and we anticipate that we tagged a mixture of American (Puget Sound) and Canadian (Fraser River) stocks. This project utilized the acoustic receiver lines currently operating in the Juan de Fuca strait, the Fraser River mouth, the lower Fraser River, and likely also an American line operating in Puget Sound (tracking data to be downloaded). The project was a collaboration with industry partners (Area B Seine Society), the Pacific Salmon Foundation, and DFO, with the objective of generating a bycatch mortality estimate for coho salmon captured in purse seine fisheries that target sockeye and pink salmon. As a research platform, we chartered a purse seine vessel and crew, and tagging involved external attachment of V8 tags using Floy Tag \"spaghetti\" tags. As this was a novel tagging method for migrating adult salmon, we simultaneously conducted a tagging validation study using an on-board net pen with 24-h holding trials. Tagged coho salmon bycatch were also evaluated for injury and reflex impairment in order to link post-release fate with fish condition. Likewise, we were able to compare fish condition with mortality in the on-board 24-h holding study (repeated 4x) in order to bolster our samples sizes for the mortality estimate.  In August of 2013, other researchers (PhD students Cook and Drenner, technicians Ward, Hills, Chapman) repeated this study in the same area and with the same crew except with increased sample sizes; 220 coho bycatch were tagged.  Unlike in 2012, pink salmon abundances were high and the vessel was chartered to simulate an actual commercial pink salmon fishery.  Therefore, mortality estimates from 2013 are likely more realistic than those from 2012.  Additionally, longer holding studies (i.e. 3 days and 4 days) were conducted using the same on-board net pen to evaluate progression of disease and stress indices following capture.\n",

      "The purpose of this investigation was to examine the temporal and environmental (e.g. temperature, tide height) patterns in the presence and abundance of resident and migratory fishes, as observed in the fish catches at two Minas Basin intertidal weirs during April – August 2013. Sampling was conducted weekly during daytime low tides from weirs in Bramber, NS and Five Islands, NS. Diel patterns were examined during two one-week periods during late July and early August at the Bramber site.  Pelagic fishes, especially those of the Clupeidae family, dominated the catches at both weirs.  Harbour porpoise presence near intertidal weirs was low during summer, especially on the north shore.\n",

      "What ecological effects does a foreshore suppletion, and a beach suppletion, have on the marine ecosystem in the intertidal and shallow surf zone (&lt;6 m depth)? The foreshore suppletion (400.000m³) was by means of an experimental set-up in the shallow coastal zone (-1 to -2m TAW) of Mariakerke. Beside it, a beach nourishment was conducted at Mariakerke (681243m³) and Middelkerke (968754m³). For the Mariakerke area, we collect biological and sedimentological samples in the impact area and in a control area (Bredene), before as after the suppletion, whereas for Middelkerke only the data after suppletion was part of the study. We monitor the marine ecosystem with a focus on the fauna within the sediment (macrofauna) and on the sediment (hyperbenthos, epi- and demersal fish fauna) in the intertidal zone and subtidal zone. In both studies, the subtidal area is the zone between the low water line and the 6m depth line and the intertdial area is the zone between low and high tide water line.\n",

This study was solely funded by CMR as a pilot study. As a result of limited funds, fish specimens were collected opportunistically from recreational fisher donations, commercial catches and from bycatch samples from scientific cruises. As a result, the capture location of the majority of specimens does not have a lat/long, and is generally only identified by the general area of capture (i.e. 'Weipa' or 'Gladstone').

      "The giant devil ray <i>Mobula mobular</i>, the only Mediterranean mobulid, is subject to mortality caused by directed and accidental captures in fisheries throughout the region. Whilst the combination of human impacts, limited range and a low reproductive potential is not inconsistent with its endangered listing, there are insufficient data to enable a quantitative assessment of trends. Without this, it is difficult to assess and prioritise threats and develop effective conservation actions. Using results from aerial surveys conducted between 2009 and 2014 over the Ligurian, Corsican, Sardinian, northern and central Tyrrhenian seas (626,228 km2), this study provides the first quantitative information on giant devil ray abundance and habitat choice in the western Mediterranean. Devil rays were observed in all seasons except winter, with their estimated abundance in the study area peaking in summer.\n",
      "The overall uncorrected mean density in the study area during summer was estimated at 0.0257 individuals km-2 (range: 0.017–0.044), resulting in a total abundance estimate of 6,092 (12.7%CV) individuals at the surface; once corrected for availability bias, this estimate indicates a summer presence of &gt;12,700 devil rays in the study area. Rays were mostly observed alone even if occasionally, larger aggregations up to a maximum of 18 individuals were observed. Although observed throughout the study area, spatial modelling identified their preferred habitat to be over a broad strip connecting the Tuscan Archipelago to Eastern Sardinia, over a wide range of water depths ranging from 10 to 2000m. The observed seasonal changes in giant devil ray distribution in this study, combined with similar evidence from other areas in the Mediterranean, support the hypothesis that the species\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: Understanding the movement and dispersal of marine animals is an important aspect of marine ecology, and has important resource management applications including the ability to assess and manage Marine Protected Areas effectively. Gilbert Bay, Labrador, was designated as an MPA under Canada's Oceans Act in 2005. Since then the movements of Atlantic cod and other species have been monitored remotely using a network of acoustic telemetry receivers. Since 2009, remote monitoring has consisted of approximately 35 receiver stations covering an area of approximately 330 square kilometres, including Gilbert Bay, Alexis Bay, and a section of the south Labrador coast. Manual tracking has been conducted in this area since 1997. This long-term acoustic monitoring  program has also detected animals from other acoustic tagging studies, including Atlantic salmon and Atlantic cod. This small receiver network, located within a sub-arctic ecosystem, is a potentially valuable contribution to the larger OTN network. This is a SPERA project dataset.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The first of three installations of in-stream tidal power infrastructure in the Minas Passage of the inner Bay of Fundy was deployed in November 2009. Little is known about the impact of turbine operation on the survival and behaviour of fishes moving through the Passage. To address the potential for fish-turbine interactions near the deployed OpenHydro turbine, we are using animal tracking technology developed by Vemco of Halifax, Nova Scotia, to track fish movement, behaviour and environmental preferences over a scale of kilometres. This project will provide real in-situ measurements of the direction, depth and velocity of tagged fishes moving through the Passage. Three species of concern will be tagged during 2010: Atlantic sturgeon, striped bass and American eels. Fishes tagged with acoustic transmitting tags will broadcast unique signals that will be archived by an array of acoustic hydrophone receivers in the Minas Passage. A dense array of receivers located at the OpenHydro turbine site will provide fine scale information on movements and behaviour of fish in relation to an operating tidal turbine. In addition a line of receivers spanning the Passage, placed in co-operation with OTN and Acadia University, will provide information on the spatial and temporal distribution and movement of fish in the Passage. To enhance the assessment of the risk to fishes of direct contact with the turbine, in situ data will be used to refine mathematical hydrodynamic models that predict how objects like fish move in the Passage and potentially interact with turbine infrastructure. This information will be valuable in identifying mitigation measures that may be taken to lessen any negative effects of in-stream turbine infrastructure on fish behaviour and survival.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project was designed to develop and promote the application of acoustic tagging technology to study the life history of Pacific salmon and other species migrating along the continental shelf of western North America. POST envisioned the eventual creation of a permanent continental-scale telemetry system, however, during its existence more limited pilot-scale arrays were deployed, primarily concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. These included several acoustic receiver curtains between Vancouver Island and the mainland, creating an excellent means by which to monitor coastal marine animal migrations, especially by juvenile salmonids (smolts) migrating to sea (see projects QCS, JDF and NSOG). In addition to arrays on the continental shelf, POST equipment was deployed upstream and in the estuaries of several major salmon-producing rivers.  POST arrays, and POST data, were incorporated into the OTN in 2012. The integration of these arrays, their equipment and the associated animal tagging projects into OTN's global network allowed for international, widespread monitoring of important species within the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Tracking data generated from the POST arrays can be applied to the development of fishery management policies aimed at the sustainable harvest of resources, and to the understanding and conservation of other marine and diadromous species.

      "Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) and manta rays (Manta spp.)represent some of the most iconic species of fish worldwide and yet only recently are their patterns of movement becoming known. Whale shark and manta site fidelity and movements in relation to ephemeral food sources and a host of environmental factors are being elucidated through a long term and multi-partner project named the MarineMeganet. The Western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico possess several aggregations of whale sharks and a large aggregation of manta rays as well as a range of other species of ocean giants that gather seasonally to feed. Although there are no targeted fisheries for the world's largest fish and ray in this region, their large and predictable aggregations remain at risk from ship strikes, uncontrolled tourism and, in the case of the whale shark, the capture of its food source (eg fish that produce the spawn that whale sharks feed on). To better understand aggregation dynamics of whale sharks and manta rays we are investigating their patterns of movement in relation to ephemeral food pulses and anthropogenic threats by deploying satellite location only tags that will provide near real time tracking information to inform the management and conservation of these species.Los tiburónes ballena (Rhincodon typus) y las manta rayas (Manta spp.) representan algunas de las especies más emblemáticas de peces en todo el mundo y sin embargo sólo recientemente sus patrones de movimiento han sido revelado. La fidelidad al sitio y los movimientos en lo referente a fuentes alimenticias efímeras y una serie de factores ambientales se están esclareciendose a través de un largo plazo y el proyecto denominado el MarineMeganet. El oeste del Caribe y el Golfo de México poseen varias agrupaciones de tiburones ballena y una gran acumulación de manta rayas, así como una variedad de otras especies de gigantes del océano que se reúnen por temporadas para alimentarse. Aunque no hay ninguna pesca regional enfocada hacia estos planktivoros grandes, sus agregaciones grandes y predecibles permanecen en riesgo de huelgas de la nave, turismo descontrolado y, en el caso del tiburón ballena, la captura de su fuente de alimento (por ejemplo los peces que producen la semilla que se alimentan de tiburones ballena).Para mejor comprender la dinámica de la agregación de tiburones ballena y de las manta rayas estamos investigando sus patrones de movimiento en relación con pulsos de alimentos efímeras y amenazas antropogénicas mediante la colocación de etiquetas satélites que proporcionarán información para la gestión y conservación de estas especies de seguimiento en tiempo casi-real.\n",

      "British Antarctic (Terra Nova) Expedition, 1910-1913 Records: 163\n",
      "The Terra Nova Expedition, officially the British Antarctic Expedition, was led by Robert Falcon Scott with the primary objective of scientific experiments, observations and gathering of specimens and the secondary objective of being the first to reach the geographical South Pole. The Terra Nova Expedition, named after its supply ship, was a private venture, financed by public contributions augmented by a government grant. It had further backing from the Admiralty, which released experienced seamen to the expedition, and from the Royal Geographical Society. As well as its polar attempt, the expedition carried out a comprehensive scientific programme. The biologist in charge of operations on the ship was Mr. D. G. Lillie, M.A., to whose skill and energy the large and valuable marine collections are mainly due. On the outward and homeward voyages from England to New Zealand fine-meshed tow-nets were put overboard whenever possible, and seventy plankton samples were obtained; in addition two hauls were made with the trawl, one near the Falklands, at a depth of 125 fathoms, and one off Rio de Janeiro, at a depth of 40 fathoms. The winter cruise (July 10th to October 10th, 1911) round the Three Kings Islands and to the north of New Zealand produced biological results of great importance; eighty plankton samples were obtained, and the seven hauls made with trawl and dredge at depths of 15 to 300 fathoms revealed a bottom-fauna of extraordinary variety, including a great number of forms new to science. Between New Zealand and McMurdo Sound one hundred and thirty-five samples of plankton and fifty of muds and oozes were obtained; in the Ross Sea and in McMurdo Sound fifteen rich hauls with the trawl, at depths of 40 to 300 fathoms, produced a collection which has added greatly to our knowledge of the Antarctic marine fauna.\n",

Two observers (at least one experienced) occupied middle seats and searched a corridor of 50 m on each side of the aircraft. Width was defined by clinometer and simple trigonometric functions. Species, numbers, behavior and other information was described on hand-held tape recorders for later transcription and computer entry.

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: Marine survival of Fraser River Chinook salmon stocks has decreased to &lt;1% in recent years and lack of information on downstream and early marine survival hampers their effective management. We conducted a small acoustic telemetry pilot study on 100 Chilko River Chinook that were reared at Chehalis Hatchery B.C. and then transported and released into the Chilko River.  The project goals were to estimate freshwater survival, investigate residence timing in the Strait of Georgia, and begin to investigate early marine survival. Because marine acoustic receiver arrays capable of detecting smolts implanted with small 180 kHz acoustic tags only monitor the northern exit from the Strait of Georgia, residence time and early marine survival could only be potentially estimated if smolts migrated north before tag batteries expired five months after ocean entry. Freshwater survival of acoustic-tagged Chinook to the Fraser River mouth (49%) was comparable to other populations or species which migrate the same distance downstream; however, their downstream migration rate 18 km/day) was dramatically slower than that of wild Chilko Lake sockeye, which migrate rapidly to the ocean after exit from Chilko Lake (100-170 km/day). It is unknown whether this behavioural difference is the result of their hatchery origin and transport to Chilko Lake. Only one fish was detected in the Strait of Georgia and none were detected exiting. Combined with the results from trawl surveys, the complete lack of detections in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait suggest that Chilko Chinook do not migrate directly north after river exit. Instead, they likely remain in the Strait of Georgia for at least several months. It is unclear if smolts eventually exited the Strait via the southern route, died during their summer residence, or simply ceased migration to take up residence. An animation of the movements of the Chilko Lake Chinook smolts released in 2016 is available on our website (http://kintama.com/visualizations/).\n",

Abstract: The Bras d'Or Lakes Array will use OTN theory and technology to determine the ecological connections between Canada's inland sea (the Bras d'Or estuary of Cape Breton), its watershed, the Scotian Shelf, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the NW Atlantic Ocean. The intent is to fully instrument the sites of exchange between the major river catchements of the watershed and the estuary, the channels linking the major basins of the estuary, and all channels of exchange between the estuary and the surrounding ocean. Motile anadromous, catadromous, and marine species of significance (e.g., Atlantic salmon, American eel, Atlantic cod) will be acoustic tagged in rivers, bays, banks, and basins of the Bras d'Or to track their movements within the estuary and its watershed, and between the estuary and the surrounding OTN arenas of the NW Atlantic Ocean.  The Bras d'Or Lakes Array will be located throughout the Bras d'Or estuary, including all channels connecting the estuarine waters to those of the surrounding ocean, the channels connecting the major basins of the estuary, and the mouths of the main rivers flowing into the estuary. The initial array is composed of 15 stations. An additional 11 sites are proposed for subsequent years, depending on the results obtained during the first tagging experiments.\n",

      "In response to population declines noted for many sharks and other elasmobranch species around the world, protecting them from overexploitation has become a global priority. However, the necessary data to assess the diversity and abundance of elasmobranchs has often hindered efforts to effectively restore and protect such species. Many reef surveys around the world have been conducted by scuba divers, although many studies have exposed the flaws and biases of this type of surveys for species such as elasmobranchs. Sampling of these species has traditionally been  resource and time intensive due to the need to capture sharks or rays on lines. Recently, advances in video technology have allowed the deployment BRUVs. This technique involves positioning a bait source in front of an underwater video camera and quantifying the fish that are observed in the field of view over a standard sampling period and are an ideal way to quickly, and inexpensively, sample populations of relatively low-density predators like sharks and rays. Due to the remote location of Isla Cayo Serranilla, in the northernmost region of the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve, there is a lack of knowledge of elasmobranch species and their abundance in the area. In order to estimate reef elasmobranch diversity and relative abundance in the Colombian Caribbean at Isla Cayo Serranilla and detect possible bright spots in the region, 52 BRUVs were deployed on the fore-reef and the inner lagoon. Depth was standardized between 8 and 30 m and deployments were performed using standardized pre-weighted bait. Videos will be watched, and species and the maximum number of reef species observed in a single frame (Nmax) will be recorded. This estimate (Nmax) is similar to the Catch per Unit of Effort (CPUE) and will be used to assess the relative abundance of reef shark at Isla Cayo Serranilla.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: In the Northwest Atlantic, the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), in collaboration with Dalhousie University, is using an acoustic telemetry infrastructure to monitor the habitat use, movements, and survival of juvenile blue sharks (Prionace glauca). This infrastructure includes state-of-the-art acoustic receivers and oceanographic monitoring equipment, and autonomous marine vehicles carrying oceanographic sensors and mobile acoustic receivers.  Long-life acoustic tags (n=40) implanted in the experimental animals will provide long-term spatial resolution of shark movements and distribution, trans-boundary migrations, site fidelity, and the species’ response to a changing ocean. This study will facilitate interspecific comparisons, documentation of intra- and interspecific interactions, and permit long-term monitoring of this understudied predator in the Northwest Atlantic. The study will also provide basic and necessary information to better inform fisheries managers and policy makers. This is pertinent given the recent formulation of the Canadian Plan of Action for Shark Conservation.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: Similar to other Chinook populations in the Salish Sea, the Cowichan River Chinook population has declined precipitously since the 1990s. Previous studies have tracked Salish Sea populations of Chinook during the winter and fall months and found that juvenile Chinook likely either remain resident in the Salish Sea beyond the time when they were tracked, or suffer very high mortality. In late summer 2017, we tested these hypotheses by acoustic-tagging 80 age-0 wild and hatchery Chinook salmon (&gt;140 mm FL) resident near the outlet of the Cowichan River in Maple Bay and Sansum Narrows. The fish were captured using microtrolling and then released near their capture locations after tagging. Mobile tracking was conducted for 10 days in September after tagging was completed, and sporadically throughout the fall. We will track their migration until spring 2018 with an array of special-purpose, short-term, receivers deployed to the north and south of the capture and release areas and at two harbour seal haul-outs. The existing POST sub-arrays in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Northern Strait of Georgia, and Discovery Islands will allow us to determine if fish remain the Salish Sea over winter. In addition to the acoustic tag, fish were implanted with a PIT tag which can ultimately be used to estimate smolt to adult survival back to the Cowichan River. Finally, we collected gill and scale samples for genetic stock dentification and to investigate infectious agents that might be present in tagged fish.i\n",

      "AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project of CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a disecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the CMAR laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII). Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the IMOS data portal: http://imos.aodn.org.au/webportal/ For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006.

Marine mortality was estimated at 24.2% with 62.5% of the mortalities occurring within the Sylvia Grinnell River estuary. Assuming an emigration date of June 18th in both 2008 and 2009, marine migration duration was 46 to 78 days. Mean durations were 59±6 in 2008, 65±7 in 2009 and 63±7 days combined. Tracking revealed migrant movements into the intertidal zone with the flood and ebb of the tide. Most detections were in surface waters (0 to 3 m). Inter/sub-tidal movements and consecutive repetitive dives (maximum 52.8 m) resulted in extreme body temperature shifts (-0.2 to18.1oC). Approximately half of intertidal and subtidal detections were between 9 to13oC, and 1 to 3oC, respectively. Stomach contents and deep diving suggested feeding in both inter/sub-tidal zones. We suggest that char tolerate cold water at depth to capture prey in the subtidal zone, then seek warmer water to enhance feeding/digestion physiology.\n",

      "Previous sea turtle abundance estimates reported in the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay where developed using aerial surveys without correcting for seasonal differences and availability bias. More recent surveys yielded estimates of availability throughout the turtles' residency periods using radio transmitters and satellite telemetry. These estimates where significantly different then previous surveys and changed over time. This project was conducted in order to quantify turtles surfacing time for the purpose of calculating seasonal and annual differences in availability, conduct aerial surveys in a manner that will allow for the calculation of perception bias, and compare estimates generated during previous projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supplemental information:\n",
      "Aerial surveys were conducted along the coastal waters and bays of Virginia and Maryland. This project is broken into two survey periods. The survey platform was a De Havilland twin otter DHC‐6 modified for observational research. The aircraft was configured so as to have two forward observers and a data recorder on their own communication system and have a second team consisting of a belly observer and one additional observer (either port or starboard) along with a data recorder. The separation of the communications systems enables the two teams to function independently thereby functioning as two individual surveys. Groups of sea turles, marine mammals, and other marine mammals were recorded. This method was developed in order to calculate a perception bias using mark recapture techniques.  This dataset is the filtered version – meaning all the duplicate sightings have been removed.  All records are marked as observed by only team one, only team two, or by both.  There is only one record for each sighting even if the animal was sighted by both teams.  The raw dataset, with all sighting from both teams, is available by request from the Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Foundation.\n",

In support of the long-term management of this MPA, an ecosystem monitoring program is currently being designed to evaluate performance relative to conservation objectives. Data describing the spatial-temporal patterns of species movement relative to MPA boundaries is essential for evaluating species composition and to gauge the protective capacity of the MPA.  In 2015, a snow crab movement monitoring project was established in the St. Anns Bank area, with collaboration between industry, the OTN and DFO.  Acoustic receiver arrays deployed as part of this project  can provide an opportunity to record the presence of tagged species who reside in, or transit through, the MPA. In particular, acoustic monitoring of tagged focal species (Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic striped wolfish (Anarhichas lupus)) inside the MPA and beyond the receiver array, will provide important information for performance evaluation and design.\n",

      "The European Union (EU) Habitats Directive requires Member States to monitor and maintain at favourable conservation status those species identified to be in need of protection, including all cetaceans. In July 2005 we surveyed the entire EU Atlantic continental shelf to generate robust estimates of abundance for harbour porpoise and other cetacean species. The survey used line transect sampling methods and purpose built data collection equipment designed to minimise bias in estimates of abundance. Shipboard transects covered 19,725 km in sea conditions &lt;= Beaufort 4 in an area of 1,005,743 km2. Aerial transects covered 15,802 km in good/moderate conditions (&lt;= Beaufort 3) in an area of 364,371 km2. Thirteen cetacean species were recorded; abundance was estimated for harbour porpoise (375,358; CV = 0.197), bottlenose dolphin (16,485; CV = 0.422), white-beaked dolphin (16,536; CV = 0.303), short-beaked common dolphin (56,221; CV = 0.234) and minke whale (18,958; CV = 0.347). Abundance in 2005 was similar to that estimated in July 1994 for harbour porpoise, white-beaked dolphin and minke whale in a comparable area. However, model-based density surfaces showed a marked difference in harbour porpoise distribution between 1994 and 2005. Our results allow EU Member States to discharge their responsibilities under the Habitats Directive and inform other international organisations concerning the assessment of conservation status of cetaceans and the impact of bycatch at a large spatial scale. The lack of evidence for a change in harbour porpoise abundance in EU waters as a whole does not exclude the possibility of an impact of bycatch in some areas. Monitoring bycatch and estimation of abundance continue to be essential.\n",

The aircraft used was a Partenavia PN68 Observer provided by the Department of Air Services, CDFG, flown at an altitude of 200' (60 m) above ground level and at a typical air speed of 90 kts. Two observers (at least one experienced) occupied middle seats and searched a corridor of 50m on each side of the aircraft. Width was defined by clinometer and simple trigonometric functions. Species, numbers, behavior and other information was described on hand-held tape recorders for later transcription and computer entry. The co-pilot position was occupied by a navigator/computer operator. This individual recorded number of observers on-watch, transect status (i.e., on-effort, off-effort, and commutes), as well as sea state, weather and other observation conditions. Date, time, and position of the aircraft were recorded directly into the data-logging computer with time, latitude and longitude provided by a Global Positioning System (GPS). \n",

      "\n",
      "In this study, 74 one-day surveys were flown through 1997.  Through the end of 1997, a total of 670 hours were flown and, exclusive of commutes, mapped bird and mammal distribution and abundance along 31,271 km (16,886 nmi) of transects. Data from several surveys from 1998 are yet fully analyzed and therefore not included in this dataset. \n",

      "Seabirds, marine mammals, and turtles are caught during commercial fishing operations within the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone. In order to monitor the impacts of fishing on these species, New Zealand government observers on fishing vessels record any protected species bycatch incidents that occur. Observer data on protected species captures are maintained by the Ministry for Primary Industries, with identification of captured animals carried out by the Department of Conservation. The data have been summarised in a series of reports, with the most recent report covering the period from 2002–03 to the end of the 2008–09 fishing year (Abraham and Thompson 2011b).\n",

To estimate total captures in a fishery, it is necessary to use statistical methods to extrapolate from the observed fishing to the unobserved fishing.

There may be additional mortalities (such as birds that are struck by fishing gear but not brought on board the vessel) that are not recorded by observers. These are referred to as ‘cryptic mortalities’ and are not included in the estimates of total captures, nor is there any evaluation of potential survival of seabirds recorded as captured but subsequently released alive. The methods used for the estimation follow those described in technical reports on bycatch estimation for seabirds (Abraham and Thompson 2011a, Abraham et al. 2013), and marine mammals (Thompson et al. 2013).\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: Fifty Seymour River steelhead smolts were double-tagged with VEMCO V9 and V4 acoustic transmitters, and then released in Malaspina Strait (east side of Texada Island in the Strait of Georgia) to migrate over acoustic arrays in the Salish Sea. The V9 transmitters allowed us to estimate early-marine survival through the northern Strait of Georgia and Discovery Islands, and provided a baseline estimate against which to evaluate the detection performance of the V4 transmitter (VEMCO’s newest, smallest transmitter). Cumulative survival over the ~170 km from release to Johnstone Strait was 46% (SE=7.0%).   Detection efficiency of the V4 was 74% (SE=10%) at the Discovery Island subarray compared to 100% for the V9 tags. Since the subarray was fully functional and the tags were operating within their warranted lifespan, we consider this to be a useful first estimate of what can be achieved with the V4 tags.An animation of the movements of the Seymour River steelhead smolts released in 2015 is available on our website (http://kintama.com/visualizations/).\n",

Marine mammal and turtle sightings were recorded within an unbounded corridor. Declination angle was measured and noted for each marine mammal/turtle sightings and later used to calculate a probability density function of frequency with right-angle sighting distance. Navigation was by Loran and VLF-Omega.  One ship survey was also conducted from aboard the NOAA ship Miller Freeman during August 1989. \n",

      "The triptcrygiid fish Grahamina signata Fricke &amp; Roberts, 1993 was described  from 174 specimens collected from several  exposed  locations around the coast of New Zealand. It was distinguished from the Tasmanian G. gymnota (Scott 1977) by  the number of pored scales in the lower lateral line, the number of branches of the supraorbital tentacle, and the colouration of the pectoral-fin base.Examination of new material of G. signata from the Auckland  region, and re-examination  of type material of  G.  gymnota,  show  that  the  supraorbital  tentacle  and  lower  lateral  line  are  not differences  of taxonomic significance. Pectoral fin colouration in a published underwater photo of G. gymnota suggests that the colour difference was due to  the  effects  of preservation. We therefore refer G. signata to the synonymy of G. gymnota. This synonymy, in combination with the restricted Tasmanian distribution and dispersal capabilities of the species, suggests that G. gymnota was introduced to Tasmania from New Zealand.\n",

      "Since November 1995, the CARIACO Ocean Time Series program has been studying the relationship between surface primary production (carbon fixation rates by photosynthesis of planktonic algae), regional hydrography, physical forcing variables (such as the wind), and the settling flux of particulate organic carbon in the Cariaco Basin. This tectonic depression, located on the continental shelf of Venezuela, shows marked seasonal and interannual variation in hydrography and primary production induced in part by the regular migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).\n",
      "The Cariaco Basin hydrography is affected by North-Atlantic gyre-scale processes, including dispersal of Subtropical Underwater and western boundary current variability, cross-equatorial flow of water masses (Wust, 1964; Muller-Karger et al., 1989), wind-driven upwelling compounded by geostrophic circulation (Richards, 1975; Muller-Karger and Aparicio-Castro, 1994i), ventilation forced by Caribbean Sea eddies (Astor et al., 2003), and river discharge (Yarincik et al., 2000; Lorenzoni, et al. 2009). Due to its restricted circulation and high primary production, the basin is anoxic below ~250 m (Muller-Karger et al., 2001; 2010). In the late 1990's and early 2000's, CARIACO observations measured annual primary production rates of more than 500 gC/m²y, of which over 15-20% was generated by events lasting one month or less. Since 2004 there has been a decrease in primary production rates (annual averages of less than 400 gC/m²y). Still, the annual primary production rates in the Cariaco Basin are comparable to rates estimated using time series observations for Monterey Bay (460 gC/m² y; Chavez, 1996), and higher than rates estimated for Georges Bank, the New York Shelf, and the Oregon Shelf (380, 300, and 190 gC/m² y, respectively; Walsh, 1988). Primary production and vertical particulate organic matter fluxes in the Cariaco Basin are higher than those observed at the oligotrophic BATS and HOT locations (Karl et al., 2001; Steinberg et al., 2001; Thunell et al., 2007). The Basin also experiences sedimentological events caused by earthquakes (Thunell et al., 1999; Lorenzoni et al., 2012) and coastal flooding (Percy et al., 2008; Lorenzoni et al., 2009). All of these phenomena can influence the sediments.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project was designed to develop and promote the application of acoustic tagging technology to study the life history of Pacific salmon and other species migrating along the continental shelf of western North America. POST envisioned the eventual creation of a permanent continental-scale telemetry system, however, during its existence more limited pilot-scale arrays were deployed, primarily concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. These included several acoustic receiver curtains between Vancouver Island and the mainland, creating an excellent means by which to monitor coastal marine animal migrations, especially by juvenile salmonids (smolts) migrating to sea (see projects QCS, JDF and NSOG). In addition to arrays on the continental shelf, POST equipment was deployed upstream and in the estuaries of several major salmon-producing rivers.  POST arrays, and POST data, were incorporated into the OTN in 2012. The integration of these arrays, their equipment and the associated animal tagging projects into OTN's global network allowed for international, widespread monitoring of important species within the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Tracking data generated from the POST arrays can be applied to the development of fishery management policies aimed at the sustainable harvest of resources, and to the understanding and conservation of other marine and diadromous species. Additional details about specific tracking projects which were originally a part of POST are only available by contacting the associated researcher.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: South Africa's Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB), located on the campus of Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa, maintains the Acoustic Tracking Array Platform (ATAP). OTN supports ATAP through equipment loans, and by working with ATAP data managers to build a telemetry data node for use by African scientists. This South African node is leveraging OTN's data toolset and templates and integrating with the OTN and its partners' data systems to help build a global tracking base. Collaboration between researchers is essential for understanding large-scale movement patterns of ecologically important species.  ATAP's arrays and data systems includes detections from equipment owned by itself, on loan from the OTN, or placed and maintained by independent partners who share data through the ATAP data node. The ATAP network provides comprehensive coastal and estuarine coverage across South Africa's coastline and north into the waters of Angola and Mozambique on Africa's west and east coasts, respectively. These arrays are providing scientists in the region with an unprecedented opportunity to study the movements of top predators such as white sharks as well as other migratory coastal and estuarine species. Additional details about individual tracking projects which are a part of ATAP are available by contacting the associated researcher.\n",

      "Understanding the drivers of species' geographic distribution has fundamental implications for the management of biodiversity. For coral reef fishes, mangroves have long been recognized as important nursery habitats sustaining biodiversity in the Western Atlantic but there is still debate about their role in the Indo-Pacific. Here, we combined LA-ICP-MS otolith microchemistry, underwater visual censuses (UVC) and mangrove cartography to estimate the importance of mangroves for the Indo-Pacific coral reef fish Lutjanus fulviflamma in the archipelago of New Caledonia. Otolith elemental compositions allowed high discrimination of mangroves and reefs with 83.8% and 98.7% correct classification, respectively. Reefs were characterized by higher concentrations of Rb and Sr and mangroves by higher concentrations of Ba, Cr, Mn and Sn. All adult L. fulviflamma collected on reefs presented a mangrove signature during their juvenile stage with 85% inhabiting mangrove for their entire juvenile life (about 1 year). The analysis of 2942 UVC revealed that the species was absent from isolated islands of the New Caledonian archipelago where mangroves were absent. Furthermore, strong positive correlations existed between the abundance of L. fulviflamma and the area of mangrove (r = 0.84 for occurrence, 0.93 for density and 0.89 for biomass). These results indicate that mangrove forest is an obligatory juvenile habitat for L. fulviflamma in New Caledonia and emphasize the potential importance of mangroves for Indo-Pacific coral reef fishes.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: Bureau of Sea Run Fisheries and Habitat (BSRFH) staff annually release excess captivereared gravid adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) broodstock for augmentation and comparison of current juvenile  production from fry stocking. Staff biologists have observed broodstock spawning, documented creation of viable redds by fry trapping, documented juvenile production to the parr lifestage by electrofishing,  and trapped emigrating smolts. However, during redd count surveys, BSRFH staff observations suggest approximately 50% of the adult salmon transplanted in a spawning stream are not seen during spawning. It is  uncertain if the unobserved adults are being removed from the stream by predators or poachers, or if they are experiencing mortality due to decreased fitness or stress prior to spawning. It is also possible that broodstock are leaving the transplanted stream and spawning in other areas of drainages. Movement of adults outside study reaches potentially  confounds wild salmon return estimates, may lead to negative biological interaction with wild conspecifics, and limits agency ability to fully assess juvenile production potential of captive-reared  broodstock. Further assessment of the movements and behavior of transplanted broodstock before, during, and after spawning is needed. The objectives of this study are: (1) to document captive-reared gravid  adult Atlantic salmon broodstock spawning behavior, locations, and movements within a release stream or in other reaches of a drainage; (2) quantitatively assess juvenile production from in-river spawning of captive-reared broodstock for comparison with production from fry point stocking; (3) document post-spawn movement of kelts; and (4) document post-spawn habitat used by  overwintering kelts.\n",

      "The Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center Foundation, Inc. (VAQF) is tasked to conduct aerial surveys for the continental shelf region off the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay within the Virginia Capes Operating Area (VACAPES OPAREA) to provide marine species monitoring services. In 2007, a multi-institutional project utilizing multiple platforms (i.e., aerial, vessel, and passive acoustic monitoring) aimed at protected species monitoring off the East Coast of the United States commenced. The current survey will complement existing United States (U.S.) Navy marine species monitoring efforts (Aerial Survey Baseline Monitoring- Atlantic Fleet Training and Testing) and supports environmental planning and regulatory compliance along the East Coast of the United States. \n",
      "\n",
      "This project represents the first year of U.S. Department of the Navy-funded aerial survey efforts off Virginia Beach, Virginia. These surveys build upon previous survey efforts funded by Virginia Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program to document large whale occurrence in the vicinity of the Virginia Wind Energy Area (VA WEA) and contribute to regional mid-Atlantic ocean planning efforts. VAQF in collaboration with University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) conducted line-transect aerial surveys from 2012 through 2016, although surveys were not flown every month or with consistent effort between years (Mallette et al. 2014, 2016). The goal of the current aerial survey project is to complement existing monitoring projects and contribute baseline protected species occurrence data, including species distribution; abundance; density estimates; and seasonal habitat usage. \n",
      "\n",
      "The survey site includes an approximately 6,500-square-kilometer area off the coast of Virginia extending from the southern portion of the eastern shore of Virginia to the North Carolina/Virginia state border. The aerial survey design was established based upon advisements from the Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modeling (CREEM) at the University of St. Andrews and objectives identified by the U.S. Navy. VAQF conducted fixed-wing aerial line-transect surveys, using previously established distance-sampling protocols, to document the occurrence of marine mammals and sea turtles. VAQF worked closely with the UNCW to maintain consistency among the safety, flight, and data-reporting protocols for Hatteras/Onslow/JAX baseline monitoring projects (McAlarney et al. 2013, 2015). The current report describes monitoring activities that occurred between January 2016 and December 2016.\n",

      "The Bay of Fundy is well known as the greatest tidal range in the world. Due to the gradual slope of the shore in the Minas Basin, the maximal extreme low water line during spring tides result in exposure of additional square miles of sub-littoral habitat for periods of usually less than 30 minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "During occasional extreme tides between 1966 and 1972, fish were examined and collected by hand from the floor of the Minas Basin off Kingsport, Kings County, at a site with high-water depths of approximately 48 feet. The area sampled was about 0.6 of a mile from strand line. The field technique was to arrive one hour before low tide and following the receding tide, searching the pools as they became exposed. The prime interest was invertebrates and fish, as collections were limited to only a few specimens of each species. On each trip, no attempt was made to collect larger specimens of skates, flounders, sea ravens, lumpfish, and goosefish. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study resulted in several new records for species not previously reported from the Minas Basin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the fish species have one or more adaptations fitting them to live in the Minas Basin intertidal zone with its dynamic semi-diurnal tides of nearly 50-foot amplitude. Examples of these adaptations according to Bleakney and McAllister (1973) were as follows: one third of the species were euryhaline (anadromous, catadromous or brackish-water tolerants); benthic fishes with flattened bodies; large broad-base heads; barbels to find food (turbidity prevents visual prey location) and perhaps mechanism to decrease clogging of gills by wave disturbed sediments.\n",
      "\n",
      "An article describing the tidal pool study was published in the Canadian Field-Naturalist (Bleakney and McAllister, 1973). Species distribution information associated with this article were digitized, standardized and republished by OBIS Canada as part of the Atlantic Coastal Zone Information Steering Committee (ACZISC) Atlantic Ecosystem Initiative (AEI) funded project “Atlantic Canada’s Biological Data for Ecosystem Planning and Decision-making”.

Aerial surveys were conducted subsequent to two naval training events in HRC. The surveys involved circumnavigation of the island of Kauai in January–February using a ASTAR 350 B2-7 helicopter, and the islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe in August using a Bell 206L3 helicopter . The associated training events (Koa Kai and Rim of the Pacific or “RIMPAC”) involved the use of mid-frequency active sonar and, in the case of RIMPAC, explosives. The Koa Kai event took place primarily on the Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range and Barking Sands Underwater Range Extension between Kauai and Niihau, Hawaii, during 24–31 January 2014. Following the Koa Kai event, shoreline surveys were conducted on 31 January and 5 February. RIMPAC took place during an extended period from 8 July through 2 August 2014 and involved a broader expanse of ocean off the main Hawaiian Islands. The aerial shoreline surveys performed subsequent to RIMPAC circumnavigated the five islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe over 4 days on 1 and 4–6 August. All surveys involved looking for stranded or near-stranded marine mammals, and observers documented the positions and behavior of all marine mammals and sea turtles seen within 3 km of shore.

      "The rhodolith beds differed significantly in terms of water motion, sediment characteristics and light levels, with Te Miko Reef having characteristics regarded as typical of rhodolith assemblages, and Kahuwhera Bay being atypical with respect to sediments and water clarity. The Te Miko Reef bed was in clear water and rhodoliths were clearly visible sitting on top of the substrate in a more or less single layer over rhodolith- and shell-derived gravel, whereas at Kahuwhera Bay there were fine sediments suspended in the water column and covering rhodoliths and associated biota, and live rhodoliths were in a more or less single layer overlaying grey to blackened rhodoliths in a darkly coloured rhodolith/sediment sublayer. The two rhodolith beds differed in current direction and strength with no clear tidal signal or direction of water motion at Kahuwhera Bay and tidally driven water movement at Te Miko Reef with a dominant northwest flow.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: Marine invasive species have become a widespread phenomenon, with devastating ecological and economic consequences. Current research focuses mainly on monitoring the ecological impacts of invasive species, rather than aiming to understand the mechanisms facilitate or drive them. Landscape characteristics such as substrate configuration, patchiness, and resource availability, are known determinants of the behavior and distribution of marine species. Such components change substantially over space and time, and little is known on how the impact of invasive species may vary accordingly. This research focuses on an invasive rabbitfish species Siganus rivulatus, previously native to the Indo-Pacific. Along the Mediterranean coast, S. rivulatus is shown to have devastating impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems’ resilience, and community structures. My research aims to understand how the species’ behavior and impact are facilitated or restricted by the surrounding landscape, directly comparing the native and invasive ranges of this species. By employing state-of-the-art technology, previously unused in Israel, fish movements will be recorded in real-time through acoustic tags. Data of such high resolution will enable to quantify fundamental parameters such as home range kernels, habitat utilization, and movement trajectories. By conducting a similar study at the native region (Red Sea; Eilat) and the invaded region (Mediterranean; Sdot-Yam) I aim to gain insight into the behavioral landscape ecology of S. rivulatus, and the behavioral shifts that may have occurred as a result of invading a novel ecosystem. Finally, movement patterns of S. rivulatus can be used to understand the degree of landscape connectivity in the Mediterranean, thereby predicting further expansion.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project was designed to develop and promote the application of acoustic tagging technology to study the life history of Pacific salmon and other species migrating along the continental shelf of western North America. POST envisioned the eventual creation of a permanent continental-scale telemetry system, however, during its existence more limited pilot-scale arrays were deployed, primarily concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. These included several acoustic receiver curtains between Vancouver Island and the mainland, creating an excellent means by which to monitor coastal marine animal migrations, especially by juvenile salmonids (smolts) migrating to sea (see projects QCS, JDF and NSOG). In addition to arrays on the continental shelf, POST equipment was deployed upstream and in the estuaries of several major salmon-producing rivers.  POST arrays, and POST data, were incorporated into the OTN in 2012. The integration of these arrays, their equipment and the associated animal tagging projects into OTN's global network allowed for international, widespread monitoring of important species within the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Tracking data generated from the POST arrays can be applied to the development of fishery management policies aimed at the sustainable harvest of resources, and to the understanding and conservation of other marine and diadromous species. Additional details about specific tracking projects which were originally a part of POST are only available by contacting the associated researcher.\n",

      "Purpose:\n",
      "On November 1, 2013, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced Dominion Virginia Power was the provisional winner of the commercial lease area offshore of Virginia (VA WEA). Development of off shore wind energy poses potential threats to marine mammals, including direct effects (i.e. vessel interactions, collision and entanglement with structures, displacement, avoidance, or injury due to noise from construction or operations) and indirect threats (i.e. effects on prey species, increased risk of fishery and vessel interaction through displacement out of the WEA) (BOEM 2012). This information is important to mitigate the potentially harmful impacts from ocean development, shipping, and other anthropogenic activities. To address these existing data gaps, we have collected marine mammal and sea turtle aerial survey sighting data off the coast of Virginia from May 2014 to 2015.\n",

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: To determine if mature female dogfish remain in Canadian waters or if they cross over the US/Canadian border to American waters. The results would have an effect on the joint management of the dogfish fishery between Canada and the US and help determine the contribution spawning females have to the NW Atlantic metapopulation of dogfish. The data would help with future management of the fishery as well as future discussions with the US.\n",

Coastal surveys and one shelf break survey were also conducted. Standard transects provided systematic coverage of shelf, slope, and offshore waters in the study area. Sightings of seabirds, pinnipeds, cetaceans, and turtles were recorded. Seabird sightings were recorded only on the shaded side of the aircraft within a strip transect of 50 m width. Marine mammal and turtle sightings were recorded within an unbounded corridor. Declination angle was measured and noted for each marine mammal/turtle sightings and later used to calculate a probability density function of frequency with right-angle sighting distance. Navigation was by Loran and VLF-Omega. One ship survey was also conducted from aboard the NOAA ship Miller Freeman during August 1989.\n",

It differs from the superficially similar E. tigris (islands of the Queensland Plateau) in lacking the three of four dark spots on the body ventral to those on the dorsal body contour below the spinous dorsal fin.

      "In 2012 and 2013, Fisheries and Oceans Canada conducted benthic imagery surveys in the Davis Strait and Baffin Basin in two areas then closed to bottom fishing, the Hatton Basin Voluntary Closure (now the Hatton Basin Conservation Area) and the Narwhal Closure (now partially in the Disko Fan Conservation Area). The photo transects were established as long-term biodiversity monitoring sites to monitor the impact of human activity, including climate change, on the region’s benthic marine biota in accordance with the protocols of the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program established by the Council of Arctic Flora and Fauna. These images were analyzed in a techncial report that summarises the epibenthic megafauna found in seven image transects from the Disko Fan Conservation Area. A total of 480 taxa were found, 280 of which were identified as belonging to one of the following phyla: Annelida, Arthropoda, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Chordata, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, Mollusca, Nemertea, and Porifera. The remaining 200 taxa could not be assigned to a phylum and were categorised as Unidentified. Each taxon was identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level, typically class, order, or family.

If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: Marine invasive species have become a widespread phenomenon, with devastating ecological and economic consequences. Current research focuses mainly on monitoring the ecological impacts of invasive species, rather than aiming to understand the mechanisms facilitate or drive them. Landscape characteristics such as substrate configuration, patchiness, and resource availability, are known determinants of the behavior and distribution of marine species. Such components change substantially over space and time, and little is known on how the impact of invasive species may vary accordingly. This research focuses on an invasive rabbitfish species Siganus rivulatus, previously native to the Indo-Pacific. Along the Mediterranean coast, S. rivulatus is shown to have devastating impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems� resilience, and community structures. My research aims to understand how the species� behavior and impact are facilitated or restricted by the surrounding landscape, directly comparing the native and invasive ranges of this species. By employing state-of-the-art technology, previously unused in Israel, fish movements will be recorded in real-time through acoustic tags. Data of such high resolution will enable to quantify fundamental parameters such as home range kernels, habitat utilization, and movement trajectories. By conducting a similar study at the native region (Red Sea; Eilat) and the invaded region (Mediterranean; Sdot-Yam) I will gain insight into the behavioral landscape ecology of S. rivulatus, and the behavioral shifts that may have occurred as a result of invading a novel ecosystem. Finally, movement patterns of S. rivulatus can be used to understand the degree of landscape connectivity in the Mediterranean, thereby predicting further expansion.\n",

This information is important to mitigate the potentially harmful impacts from ocean development, shipping, and other anthropogenic activities. To address these existing data gaps, we have collected marine mammal sighting data from multiple platforms in addition to sea turtle sighting data off the coast of Virginia from 2012 to 2014.\n",

Hydrothermal vent fauna are reliant upon the productivity associated with vent flow and require special adaptations in order to tolerate the variety of challenges posed by potentially toxic chemicals and a wide range of temperatures. Thus, characterizing the habitats of the fauna is a criti.cal first step in understanding their ecology, but can be quite difficult and time consuming in these complex, remote, and relatively inaccessible environments.\n",
      "The 400 km-long Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) is located in the Lau back-arc basin, bordered on the west by the remnant Lau arc and on the east by the active Tofua volcanic arc and the Kingdom of Tonga. Lau Basin fauna are generally similar to that of other back-arc basins and deep subduction zones (Manus and North Fiji Basins and Okinawa and Mariana Troughs) within the Western Pacific hydrothermal vent biogeographic province.\n",
      "In 2005 and 2006, we selected four discrete vent communities within three different andesite-hosted vent fields along the ELSC (ABE, Tu’i Malila, Kilo Moana and Tow Cam) and used the ROV JASON II to photographically and physico-chemically characterize each community. One purpose of this study was to develop an explorative technique that combines high-resolution, geographically referenced imagery, in-situ physico-chemical measurements (Luther et al., 2001; Nuzzio et al., 2002), and GIS in order to identify correlations between faunal distributions and abiotic and biotic factors across significant portions of a vent community (40–50 m2).\n",

The NBI is a data source for the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and provides additional source of data on marine-benthic invertebrate species from studies conducted throughout the United States. The NBID component provides a basis for fulfilling important data needs of customers, such as providing information on the incidence and patterns of occurrence of a particular species of interest, or on the overall composition and diversity of species assemblages within any particular region of interest. Other key objectives of the NBID component are: (1) to provide a source of information for assessing patterns in marine biodiversity; (2) to provide input data for evaluating biological responses to sediment-associated stressors, and for developing new diagnostic tools to enhance such analyses; and (3) to provide a basis for monitoring the incidence and patterns of invasive species in marine and coastal waters (taking advantage of the fact that such a comprehensive database includes species from most all known marine invertebrate phyla, and thus will be broadly representative). Samples were live-sieved in the field on 0.5mm wire mesh sieves and all material retained on the screen was preserved with 10% buffered formalin with Rose Bengal dye. In the laboratory these previously fixed samples were re-sieved and transferred to a 70%-ethanol solution. All benthic macro-infauna retained on the 0.5mm screen were identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level, usually species. The level of taxonomy varied depending upon the salinity of the habitat from which the samples were collected. Oligochaetes and chironomids from tidal fresh and oligohaline salinity zones were identified to species (or lowest possible taxon) whereas individuals of these groups from higher salinities (&gt; 5 ppt) were not identified to the species level. Additionally, certain faunal groups were not identified to the species level due to inherent taxonomic difficulties associated with the group and the limited value to be gained relative to the effort required for the additional level of detail. These groups and the corresponding level of expected taxonomic classification are as follows: Phylum Porifera (Sponges); Phylum Ectoprocta (Bryozoans); Class Hydrozoa - Order (e.g., Hydroida, Actinulida); Class Hirudinea; Class Anthozoa - Order [e.g., Alcyonacea (soft corals), Gorgonacea (sea fans and whips), Pennnatulacea (sea pens), Actiniaria (sea anemones), Scleractinia, (stony corals), Ceriantharia]; Other Dipteran Families - Family (e.g., Ceratopogonidae, Chaoboridae).

The surveys involved circumnavigation of the island of Kauai in January–February using a ASTAR 350 B2-7 helicopter, and the islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe in August using a Bell 206L3 helicopter . The associated training events (Koa Kai and Rim of the Pacific or “RIMPAC”) involved the use of mid-frequency active sonar and, in the case of RIMPAC, explosives. The Koa Kai event took place primarily on the Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range and Barking Sands Underwater Range Extension between Kauai and Niihau, Hawaii, during 24–31 January 2014. Following the Koa Kai event, shoreline surveys were conducted on 31 January and 5 February. RIMPAC took place during an extended period from 8 July through 2 August 2014 and involved a broader expanse of ocean off the main Hawaiian Islands. The aerial shoreline surveys performed subsequent to RIMPAC circumnavigated the five islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe over 4 days on 1 and 4–6 August. All surveys involved looking for stranded or near-stranded marine mammals, and observers documented the positions and behavior of all marine mammals and sea turtles seen within 3 km of shore.

      "Shorekeepers is a rigorous monitoring methodology. The key to getting reliable scientific data is to use standard survey methods so that everyone is collecting data in the same way over time at all sites. A monitoring guide developed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada presents an intertidal surveying methodology. The method is presented in a logical step-by-step manner starting from selecting a study area through each type of measurement to entering the field data into the database, and finally, reporting the results. After a few days of training in habitat mapping and species identification, community members can use these step-by-step protocols to routinely monitor their site of interest or concern. The challenge is to distinguish natural changes from human-induced ones over time. Nevertheless, the resulting data will help us all to gain a better understanding of these dynamic ecosystems, and to make wiser decisions about coastal development and marine conservation.\n",

      "Several bureaus within the Department of Interior compiled available information from seabird observation datasets from the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf into a single database, with the goal of conducting research and informing coastal and offshore planning activities.  The cooperators were the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) Environmental Studies Program (http://www.boem.gov/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Studies/Environmental-Studies.aspx), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) Division of Migratory Bird Management (http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/) and the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov).  The resulting product is the Atlantic Offshore Seabird Dataset Catalog, which characterizes the survey effort and bird observations that have been collected across space and time. As of December 2013, the database contains over 70 datasets from 1906-2013 with about 300,000 records of seabird observations. Data were initially provided as summary web mapping services, with web feature services (for downloading and looking at single-species data) at the linkage given elsewhere in this document.  A full archive of the scientific data is available at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC).  The data archived at NODC is comprised of roughly 50 datasets from 1938-2013 with about 260,000 observation records.  This archive is a subset of the main database, excluding datasets from surveys where the scientific design was not specifically designed to sample marine birds (e.g. coastal portions of National Audubon Society's Christmas Bird Counts).\n",

These tagged seals were weighed again at weaning, when length, girth, fat depth, and flipper measurements were made. Three weeks after weaning 2000 seals were permanently and individually marked by hot-iron branding. Recaptures and re-weighing of these known aged individuals were used to calculate growth and age-specific survival of the seals.\n",

      "The PIROP (Programme Intégré de recherches sur les oiseaux pélagiques) data set, Atlantic subset, consists of geo-referenced vessel-based surveys to monitor pelagic seabirds. Most surveys were carried out by R.G. B. Brown from 'vessels of opportunity' supplied by the Bedford Institute for Oceanography (BIO) in Dartmouth/Halifax, but many other platforms and observers were used, too. During these surveys observations other than seabirds were also recorded, e.g. Waterfowl, Waterbirds, Songbirds, Raptors, Owls, Sea Mammals, and other sightings of interest (weather, oceanography, vessel activities, bird behaviour, etc.). The data collection period covers all seasons of 1966-1992, with most surveys being conducted between (late) summers of 1975-1987. The survey protocol originally consisted of unlimited width 10min transects, but was changed appr. 1984 towards a Tasker et al. (1984) type of survey (fixed-width strip transect). However, data and results from the PIROP database need to be interpreted as relative, and not absolute, abundance.\n",

      "The near and offshore waters of Atlantic Canada support millions of marine birds, including coastal and island breeders, as well as migrants from the southern hemisphere and northeastern Atlantic. Although tied to land during the breeding season when they raise their young, seabirds exist mostly in the marine environment. Since many spend much of their lives out of sight of land, knowledge of their pelagic distribution and ecology can be difficult to obtain. In 2005 the Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment Canada (EC-CWS) set up a monitoring program for seabirds at sea.  This program is ongoing and provides data on current seabird abundance and distribution in order to address conservation and management objectives related to the offshore.  The sampling strategy relies on ships-of-opportunity that travel throughout the region at all times of the year. The data provide critical information for environmental assessments of offshore developments, identify areas where birds are at high risk for oil pollution and other human activities, and enable us to monitor trends in the marine environment. In addition, the biological, chemical, and physical data collected concurrently by oceanographers with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans provide the means to examine the linkages between seabirds and their marine habitats.\n",

      "In order to establish a baseline map of cetaceans and other pelagic megafauna across the French EEZ, the French agency for marine protected areas (AAMP) decided to conduct a series of surveys allowing hotspots of abundance and diversity to be identified and a future monitoring scheme to be established. A dedicated aerial survey methodology, following standard protocols, was preferred to ship surveys. The general design corresponds to published protocols prepared for small cetaceans, but data for other marine mammals (large whales, sirenians), seabirds, sea-turtles, large teleosts and large elasmobranchs) are collected as well. Data collected include species, group size, angle to survey track for cetaceans located within 500m on both sides of survey track, allowing line transect data analyses. For seabirds all encounters located within 200m on both sides of survey track are recorded for strip-transect analysis. Covariates collected on board include sea-state, turbidity, glare and cloud coverage. The study areas include all sectors of the French EEZ: North-East Atlantic, the tropical Atlantic (French Caribbean and Guiana), Indian (Reunion Island, Mayotte and the Scattered Islands) and south Pacific oceans (French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna). \n",

The transects sampled on a given survey were selected randomly from a set of 92 standard (predetermined) lines spaced at intervals of 5’ of latitude.  Standard transects provided systematic coverage of shelf, slope, and offshore waters in the study area. Sightings of seabirds, pinnipeds, and sea otters were recorded only on low-altitude surveys. Sightings of cetaceans and turtles were recorded on both low- and high-altitude surveys. Seabird sightings were recorded only on the shaded side of the aircraft within a strip transect of 50 m width. Marine mammal and turtle sightings were recorded within an unbounded corridor on both high- and low-altitude surveys, but only the shaded side of the aircraft was searched on the low-altitude surveys. Cross-legs connecting standard transects were searched only on high-altitude surveys. Offshore cross-legs were searched on both sides of the aircraft, while only the nearshore side was searched on cross-legs along the coast. Declination angle was measured and noted for each marine mammal/turtle sightings and later used to calculate a probability density function of frequency with right-angle sighting distance. Navigation was by Loran and VLF-Omega.\n",

      "Databases produced: Three databases of sightings at sea were produced by these studies (data on  numbers of seabirds and pinnipeds on land were also collected but are not addressed in the present study). These include: 1) sightings of cetaceans and turtles recorded on 36 high-altitude aerial surveys, 2) sightings of cetaceans, pinnipeds, sea otters, and turtles recorded on 36 low-altitude aerial surveys, and 3) sightings of seabirds on 36 low-altitude aerial surveys. Each sighting database is accompanied by files providing the search effort on transect and environmental characteristics of the waters surveyed (e.g., sea surface temperature).\n",

      "In support of New York State's commitment to incorporating offshore wind into its energy portfolio, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) embarked on a multi-year ultrahigh-resolution aerial digital survey of marine resources in a 12,650 square nautical mile offshore planning area (OPA) in 2016. The OPA encompasses the waters of the New York Bight from Long Island southeast to the continental shelf break. Surveys are conducted on a quarterly basis, timed to coincide with periods of abundance of avian and marine species vulnerable to impacts from offshore wind activities. This report summarizes the results of the first two surveys conducted in July–August and November 2016. Each survey collected images covering at least 7% of the OPA.\n",

Some seasonal patterns were evident. During the summer survey, the vast majority of the organisms observed were rays (8,388 images) or birds (1,893 images). During the fall survey, birds predominated (12,352 images). Shearwaters, storm-petrels, and terns were substantially more abundant in the summer while ducks, gannets, gulls and phalaropes were substantially more abundant in the fall. Turtles, sharks, and large bony fishes were all most abundant in the summer, though present in the fall. Number of images with marine mammals was similar in both surveys.\n",

      "Spatial patterns were apparent in some taxonomic groups. A number of species tended to occur in nearshore waters including large gulls and least, royal and Sterna terns. Turtles typically occurred inshore of the 70 m isobath. Audubon's, sooty, and Cory's shearwaters clustered in the northeast corner of the OPA. Whales, Audubon's shearwaters, and black-capped petrels were most common near the shelf break. While sharks exhibited no clear patterns, rays showed some tendency to cluster off the mouth of New York Harbor. Large bony fishes typically occurred in deeper waters.\n",

      "Over the last decade, the Integrated Marine Observing System’s Animal Tracking Facility (IMOS ATF) has established a permanent array of acoustic receivers around Australia to detect the movements of tagged marine animals in coastal waters. Simultaneously, IMOS ATF developed a centralised national database (https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au/) to encourage collaborative research across the user community and provide unprecedented opportunities to quantify individual behaviour across a broad range of taxa. Here we present the database and quality control procedures developed to collate 48.5 million valid detections from 1891 receiving stations. This dataset consists of detection data for 3523 tags deployed on 117 species (fish, sharks, rays, reptiles, and mammals), with distances travelled ranging from a few to thousands of kilometres. This dataset of acoustic detections constitutes a valuable resource facilitating meta-analysis of animal movement, distributions, and habitat use, and is important for relating species distribution shifts with environmental covariates.\n",

This dataset has been summarized by reducing the detection records to the count of detections per animal per site per day (UTC).

      "The 4 charts show the locations of over 50,000 captures of 4 whale species; sperm whales (36,908), right whales (8,415), humpback whales (2,883) and bowhead whales (5,114). Capture locations were transcribed from North American (“Yankee”) pelagic whale vessel log books dating from 1761 to 1920 and plotted onto nautical charts in a Mercator projection by a cartographer. Each point plotted on the charts represents the location of a whaling ship on a day when one or more whales were taken and is symbolized by month of the year using a combination of color and open and closed circles.\n",
      "Townsend and his cartographer plotted vessel locations as accurately as possible according to log book records.  When plotting locations on an earlier sperm whale chart published in 1931 the cartographer spaced points where locations were very dense, \"extending areas slightly\" for a number of whaling grounds. However, for charts in preparation at this time, Townsend states that \"this difficulty is avoided by omitting some of the data, rather than extend the ground beyond actual whaling limits.\" We assumed that this statement refers to the 1935 charts but there is still some question as to whether the cartographer did in fact space locations and thus expand whaling grounds. \n",

      "Purpose:\n",
      "This dataset provides point features that represent the historical locations of right whale catches taken by North American pelagic whaling vessels between 1761 to 1920. Points were derived from 4 charts that were first scanned on a large format scanner at a resolution of 200 dpi. The charts were then georeferenced in the native projection of the charts, the Mercator projection, using GIS software (ESRI ArcView 3.2). Each vessel capture location plotted on the charts was then digitized as a point feature and attributed with the month of capture. One GIS file (ESRI shapefile) was then created for each whale species represented by the charts; sperm whale, right whale, humpback whale and bowhead whale.\n",
      "Digitizing errors include missed points, particularly from areas of dense chart locations, and incorrect assignment of month of capture because of difficulty distinguishing between chart colors. However to limit these errors multiple checks of digitized and chart locations were made and color enhancements of chart scans were used to ensure correct month assignments. Overall we are confident that at least 95% of catch locations have been digitized and that at least 95% of month attributes are correct.\n",

From the late 1970s, data have also been obtained from research vessels, coast guard vessels, some fishing vessels and inspectors. These reports contain basic information on date, position and species, but also additional information such as group sizes. These sightings are not useful for assessing abundance, but might reveal distributional aspects. Most of the reports come from the northern areas (Barents Sea); this is clearly related to the distribution of the activities which form the basis for this kind of reporting.\n",

      "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), formerly the Minerals Management Service (MMS), and its precursor, the Bureau of Land Management, have funded aerial surveys in the Beaufort, Chukchi and Bering Seas since 1979. In 2008, through an Inter-Agency Agreement between BOEMRE and the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) (Alaska Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), NMML assumed full responsibility for these surveys. Consistent survey protocol has been in effect on surveys conducted since 1982.\n",
      "Aerial surveys in the western Beaufort Sea (south of 72 degrees N, 140-157 degrees W) have been conducted each year since 1979. MMS (now BOEMRE) personnel and contractors conducted the surveys from 1979-2007. From 2008-2010, the surveys were conducted by NMML. The goal of the project, also known as the Bowhead Whale Aerial Survey Project (BWASP), was to document bowhead whales (<i>Balaena mysticetus</i>) during their fall migration through the western Beaufort Sea, although data were also collected for all other marine mammals that were sighted during the surveys. The surveys were typically conducted during the open water (i.e., ice-free) months of September and October, when offshore drilling and geophysical exploration are feasible and when the fall subsistence hunt for bowhead whales takes place near Kaktovik, Cross Island (village of Nuiqsut), and Barrow, Alaska. Additional surveys were conducted in the Beaufort Sea during spring and summer 1979-1986. The emphasis of fall surveys in the Beaufort Sea was to conduct broad-scale surveys to assess shifts in the migration pathway of bowhead whales, and to coordinate effort and manage data necessary to support seasonal offshore drilling and seismic exploration regulations. The selection of survey blocks to be flown on a given day was nonrandom, based primarily on criteria such as observed and predicted weather conditions over the study area and offshore oil industry activities. Otherwise, the project attempted to distribute effort fairly evenly east-to-west across the entire study area. Aerial coverage favored inshore survey blocks because bowheads were rarely sighted north of these blocks during surveys conducted from 1979-1986.\n",
      "Aerial surveys in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (68-73 degrees N, 157-169 degrees W) were conducted by MMS (now BOEMRE) contractors from 1982-1991. From 2008-2010, the surveys were conducted by NMML using similar methodology to the surveys conducted in previous years. The goal of the surveys, now known as the Chukchi Offshore Monitoring in Drilling Area (COMIDA) marine mammal aerial survey project, was to investigate the distribution and relative abundance of marine mammals in the Chukchi Sea Planning Area (CSPA) during the open water (i.e., ice-free) months of June to October, when various species are undertaking seasonal migrations through the area. However, from 1979-1984, surveys were also conducted during spring.\n",
      "Aerial surveys in the northern Bering and southern Chukchi Seas (63-68 degrees N, east of the International Date Line) were conducted by MMS (now BOEMRE) contractors from 1979-1985. The goal of these surveys was to investigate the distribution, abundance, migration timing, habitat relationships and behavior of endangered whales during the spring migration. Surveys were conducted from April-July. This database contains aerial survey data from the surveys described above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "The goals of the Bowhead Whale Aerial Survey Project (BWASP) have changed minimally since the surveys commenced in 1979. Objectives of the surveys since the late 1980s were to 1) Define the annual fall migration of bowhead whales, significant inter-year differences, and long-term trends in the distance from shore and water depth at which whales migrate, 2) Monitor temporal and spatial trends in the distribution, relative abundance, habitat, and behaviors (especially feeding) of endangered whales in arctic waters, 3) Provide real-time data to MMS and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) on the general progress of the fall migration of bowhead whales across the Alaskan Beaufort Sea for use in protection of this endangered species, 4) Provide an objective wide area context for management interpretation of the overall fall migration of bowhead whales and site-specific study results, 5) Record and map beluga whale distribution and incidental sightings of other marine mammals, 6) Determine seasonal distribution of endangered whales in other planning areas of interest to BOEMRE.\n",
      "The goals of the Chukchi Offshore Monitoring in Drilling Area (COMIDA) marine mammal aerial survey project commencing in 2008 were to 1) Provide data compatible with the MMS marine mammal database directly to MMS for inclusion in that database and for use in estimation of the distribution of cetaceans and pinnipeds in the CSPA from 3 surveys during June-November, 2) Document geographical areas of importance for specific behaviors including calving/pupping, feeding, hauling-out, and migrating, 3) Provide timely information on marine mammal observations and environmental conditions, including ice conditions, following each survey flight to organizations as directed by the COR (e.g., National Ice Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, MMS) for real-time management of activities in the region.\n",
      "The goals of the surveys conducted in the northern Bering and southern Chukchi Seas from 1979-1985 were to, 1) Determine seasonal distribution, migration routes, relative abundance, and habitat characteristics of endangered whales in or near existing proposed federal lease sales in the northern Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, 2) Derive estimates and indicators of relative and/or absolute abundance of endangered whales in these areas, 3) Describe behavioral characteristics of endangered whales observed in these areas, 4) Deploy sonobuoys to detect sounds produced by whales, to be used as additional indices of whale presence in these areas, 5) Obtain distributional information on non-endangered marine mammal sightings incidental to other investigations, 6) Consult and coordinate field activities with other federal agencies, state or local government organizations, or other endangered species researchers to maximize productivity of this study and minimize conflict with other resource uses.\n",

      "Methodology: Aerial and ship surveys were conducted along pre-established transects designed to systematically sample marine mammal and seabird abundance in all waters of the study area. Aerial surveys were conducted at two altitudes (200 ft and about 750-1,000 ft ASL) alternating at 2-3 week intervals. Seabirds and pinnipeds were recorded only on the low-altitude surveys which predominantly sampled along eight lines of latitude, separated by 25 nm, and connecting lines of longitude. High-altitude surveys sampled cetacean abundance along 15 Loran lines oriented northeast-southwest and separated by 12-15 nm. On low-altitude surveys, seabirds were counted only within a 50 m corridor on the shaded side of the aircraft. Marine mammals were counted in an unbounded corridor on one side of the aircraft on low-altitude surveys and both sides of the aircraft on high-altitude surveys. A clinometer or marks on the wing-strut were used to estimate the declination, and the measurement or estimate later used to calculate probability density functions of frequency with right-angle distance. Ships were used for surveys of inshore waters along standard (i.e., predetermined and replicate) transects and for search, catch, and tagging/tracking of small cetaceans. The standard ship transect cruises sampled abundance of seabirds and marine mammals over banks, basins, and ridges in waters inshore of the Patton Escarpment (the shelf break). Seabirds and marine mammals were counted on both sides of the cruise track and distance estimated or measured with a range-finder. Catch cruises attempted to find and remain with schools of common dolphin and other small cetaceans; therefore, data on sightings from these cruises cannot be used as samples of animal abundance. The Southern California Bight Study also included ground and aerial censuses of pinniped and seabird colonies, and special studies of productivity, mortality rates, and foraging range. \n",

      "The word “synoptic” means presenting a general view of the whole. The current manatee synoptic survey is a count of manatees over a broad area. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) uses these surveys to obtain a general count of manatees statewide. The FWC coordinates an interagency team that conducts the synoptic surveys from one to three times each year (weather permitting). The synoptic surveys are conducted in winter and cover all of the known wintering habitats of manatees in Florida. The survey is conducted to meet Florida state statute 370.12 (4), which requires an annual, impartial, scientific benchmark census of the manatee population. From 1991 through 2011, the counts have been conducted 27 times. These statewide, interagency surveys are currently conducted during the coldest weather of the year (January through March) when manatees move to warm-water sites, such as natural springs, thermal discharges from power and industrial plants, and deep canals. The ideal conditions for the current synoptic survey are cool weather, following a prolonged period of cold weather (usually following multiple cold fronts), low winds, and bright sunshine. Weather conditions and manatee behavior during the survey have a large effect on the synoptic counts. For that reason, the counts are used as indicators of relative abundance within a year and are not suitable for assessing long-term population trends. Counts can vary depending on whether it is warm or cold, sunny or cloudy, calm or windy. Manatees are more easily counted a few days after a cold front when it is slightly warmer, clear, and windless. A warming trend with sunny, windless conditions following cold weather increases the likelihood that manatees will be resting at the water's surface, where observers can easily spot them.\n",

The animals were described as \"Fishes Royal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1913, by agreement with the then Board of Trade, these rights were transferred to the Natural History Museum in London, at that time known as the British Museum (Natural History). Since then, in monitoring cetacean strandings, over 8,000 animals have been recorded, some of the species being new to British waters. Initially, information was stored on a card index. Latterly, information is collated and entered on computer. The resulting database is used to produce <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/strandings/distribution.html\">distribution maps</a> and analyze information about the biology and ecology of the different species.\n",

Museum scientists study the remains of dead stranded cetaceans to learn more about their biology.

      "Associated publication abstract: Increasingly disrupted and altered, the world’s oceans are subject to immense and intensifying anthropogenic pressures. Of the biota inhabiting these ecosystems, marine birds are among the most threatened. For conservation efforts targeting marine birds to be effective, quantitative information relating to their at-sea density and distribution is typically a crucial knowledge component. In this study, we generated predictive machine learning ensemble models for 13 marine bird species and 7 groups (representing 24 additional species) in Canada’s Pacific coast waters, including several species listed under Canada’s Species at Risk Act. Predictive models were based on systematic marine bird line transect survey information collected in spring, summer, and fall on Canada’s Pacific coast (2005−2008). Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS) was used to estimate marine bird density along transect segments. Spatial and temporal environmental predictors, including remote sensing information, were used in model ensembles, which were constructed using 4 machine learning algorithms in Salford Systems Predictive Modeler v7.0 (SPM7): Random Forests, TreeNet, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and Classification and Regression Trees. Predictive models were subsequently combined to generate seasonal and overall predictions of areas important to marine birds based on normalized marine bird species or group richness and densities. Our results employ open access data sharing and are intended to better inform marine bird conservation efforts and management planning on Canada’s Pacific coast and for broader-scale geographic initiatives across North America and elsewhere.\n",

      "Eastern North Pacific gray whales make one of the longest annual migrations of any mammal, traveling from their summer feeding areas in the Bering and Chukchi Seas to their wintering areas in the lagoons of Baja California, Mexico. Although a significant body of knowledge on gray whale biology and behavior exists, little is known about their vocal behavior while migrating. In this study, we used a sparse hydrophone array deployed offshore of central California to investigate how gray whales behave and use sound while migrating. We detected, localized, and tracked whales for one full migration season, a first for gray whales. We verified and localized 10,644 gray whale M3 calls and grouped them into 280 tracks. Results confirm that gray whales are acoustically active while migrating and their swimming and acoustic behavior changes\n",
      "on daily and seasonal time scales. The seasonal timing of the calls verifies the gray whale migration timing determined using other methods such as counts conducted by visual observers. The total number of calls and the percentage of calls that were part of a track changed significantly over both seasonal and daily time scales. An average calling rate of 5.7 calls/whale/day was observed, which is significantly greater than previously reported migration calling rates. We measured a mean speed of 1.6 m/s and quantified heading, direction, and water depth where tracks were located. Mean speed and water depth remained constant between night and day, but these quantities had greater variation at night. Gray whales produce M3 calls with a root mean square source level of 156.9 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m. Quantities describing call characteristics were variable and dependent on site-specific propagation characteristics.\n",

      "This dataset, belonging as a whole to Tethys Research Institute, comprises the work carried out between 1986 and 2012 mainly in the Mediterranean Sea and in particular in the Corso-Ligurian-Provencal basin, in the Ionian Sea and in the Adriatic Sea. Research has also been carried out investigating cetaceans in Atlantic Ocean (Canary Islands, Morocco coasts) and in the Caribbean Sea. The dataset generated includes more than 8.400 sightings of cetaceans collected in 25 years of research activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "Founded in 1986, the Tethys Research Institute is a private non-profit organization specializing in cetacean research. Tethys has generated one of the largest datasets on Mediterranean cetaceans and contributed over 300 scientific publications. Tethys aims to protect the Mediterranean biodiversity by promoting the adoption of a precautionary approach for the management of natural resources. The work carried out by Tethys strives to prevent the decline of marine species and to encourage sustainable use of the marine environment. Tethys first conceived and proposed the creation a Marine Reserve in the Corso-Ligurian Basin, the “Pelagos Sanctuary.” Several internationally renowned institutions have emphasized the importance of the Sanctuary, including the World Conservation Union (IUCN), the Bonn Convention on migratory species, and the newly-born Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Areas (ACCOBAMS). The Sanctuary has also been added to the list of Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMI), created at the Barcelona Convention in 1999. This makes the Ligurian Sea Cetacean Sanctuary the first and only high seas protected area in the world. Moreover, based primarily on data collected by the Tethys Research Institute, a Dolphin Reserve was formally established in Losinj, Croatia in 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research methods utilized by Tethys include the use of remote sensing and telemetry data, the combined use of laser range-finding binoculars and GPS to record the movements of whales, population studies based on distance sampling and photographic capture-recapture, bioacoustics research, behavioral sampling, remote collection of biopsy samples for genetic and toxicological analyses, and historical studies. The Institute holds vast photographic archives of cetacean images that have enabled the identification of over 1,500 individuals of eight Mediterranean species.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tethys Research Institute has involved in its expeditions thousands of people from all over the world, and has developed a remarkable cetacean research and conservation network. Tethys has been conducting its research and conservation activities thanks to support received from national and international organizations. Tethys is partner to the UNEP's Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The Italian Ministry of the Environment funded various cetacean research and conservation activities carried out by the Institute. The UNEP's Regional Activity Centre for Specially Protected Areas (RAC-SPA), the Earthwatch Institute, OceanCare and The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society WDCS have been providing support to specific projects conducted by Tethys in the context of a long-term collaboration.\n",

      "Seabirds, marine mammals, and turtles are caught during commercial fishing operations within the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone. In order to monitor the impacts of fishing on these species, New Zealand government observers on fishing vessels record any protected species bycatch incidents that occur. Observer data on protected species captures are maintained by the Ministry for Primary Industries, with identification of captured animals carried out by the Department of Conservation. The data have been summarised in a series of reports, with the most recent report covering the period from 2002–03 to the end of the 2008–09 fishing year (Abraham and Thompson 2011b).\n",

      "Observers are only present on some fishing vessels. To estimate total captures in a fishery, it is necessary to use statistical methods to extrapolate from the observed fishing to the unobserved fishing. The total observable captures are an estimate of the captures that would have been reported, had observers been present on all fishing vessels. There may be additional mortalities (such as birds that are struck by fishing gear but not brought on board the vessel) that are not recorded by observers. These are referred to as ‘cryptic mortalities’ and are not included in the estimates of total captures, nor is there any evaluation of potential survival of seabirds recorded as captured but subsequently released alive. The methods used for the estimation follow those described in technical reports on bycatch estimation for seabirds (Abraham and Thompson 2011a, Abraham et al. 2013), and marine mammals (Thompson et al. 2013).\n",

      "Methodology: Aerial and ship surveys were conducted along pre-established transects designed to systematically sample marine mammal and seabird abundance in all waters of the study area. Aerial surveys were conducted at two altitudes (200 ft and about 750-1,000 ft ASL) alternating at 2-3 week intervals. Seabirds and pinnipeds were recorded only on the low-altitude surveys which predominantly sampled along eight lines of latitude, separated by 25 nm, and connecting lines of longitude. High-altitude surveys sampled cetacean abundance along 15 Loran lines oriented northeast-southwest and separated by 12-15 nm. On low-altitude surveys, seabirds were counted only within a 50 m corridor on the shaded side of the aircraft. Marine mammals were counted in an unbounded corridor on one side of the aircraft on low-altitude surveys and both sides of the aircraft on high-altitude surveys. A clinometer or marks on the wing-strut were used to estimate the declination, and the measurement or estimate later used to calculate probability density functions of frequency with right-angle distance. Ships were used for surveys of inshore waters along standard (i.e., predetermined and replicate) transects and for search, catch, and tagging/tracking of small cetaceans. The standard ship transect cruises sampled abundance of seabirds and marine mammals over banks, basins, and ridges in waters inshore of the Patton Escarpment (the shelf break). Seabirds and marine mammals were counted on both sides of the cruise track and distance estimated or measured with a range-finder. Catch cruises attempted to find and remain with schools of common dolphin and other small cetaceans; therefore, data on sightings from these cruises cannot be used as samples of animal abundance. The Southern California Bight Study also included ground and aerial censuses of pinniped and seabird colonies, and special studies of productivity, mortality rates, and foraging range.\n",

During the 1970s, sighting data came primarily from surveys searching for tagged dolphins, from radio-tracking, and from a few photographic identification efforts (Irvine et al. 1981; Wells et al. 1980).  From 1980-1992, data came primarily from seasonal, systematic photographic identification surveys (Wells et al. 1987, Wells and Scott 1990, Scott et al. 1990, Wells 1991).   Focused photographic identification surveys of the Gulf of Mexico waters offshore of Sarasota Bay, Florida, occurred during July 1997 through August 1998 (Fazioli et al. 2006).  Building on these, biopsy darting and photo-ID occurred in the same waters during 1999-2000 (Sellas et al. 2000).

      "Seal populations in the northwest Atlantic are thriving, yet few grant dollars go to seal projects in the northeast region. According to many researchers and managers in the region, the healthy state of stocks is exactly why we should be studying seals. Seal and human activities along the coast often result in conflicts, which will undoubtedly increase as the population and range of both seals and humans increase. The east coast of the United States lacks a management plan for seals. A problem that seriously impedes management is that managers do not know where the seals are and more specifically, where haul-out sites are. This atlas is designed to aid managers and researchers in the management and conservation of seals in the northwest Atlantic. The atlas and the data used to create the atlas can be accessed through OBIS-SEAMAP.\n",

      "Aerial surveys were conducted along the coastal waters and bays of Virginia and Maryland. This project is broken into two survey periods. The survey platform was a De Havilland twin otter DHC‐6 modified for observational research. The aircraft was configured so as to have two forward observers and a data recorder on their own communication system and have a second team consisting of a belly observer and one additional observer (either port or starboard) along with a data recorder. The separation of the communications systems enables the two teams to function independently thereby functioning as two individual surveys. Groups of sea turles, marine mammals, and other marine mammals were recorded. This method was developed in order to calculate a perception bias using mark recapture techniques.  This dataset is the filtered version – meaning all the duplicate sightings have been removed.  All records are marked as observed by only team one, only team two, or by both.  There is only one record for each sighting even if the animal was sighted by both teams.  The raw dataset, with all sighting from both teams, is available by request from the Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Foundation.\n",

      "Alnitak is a non-governmental non-profit association, founded in 1990 with the main aim of developing studies in cooperation with universities, environmental organizations and other institutions to increase our knowledge on the marine and coastal environment and thereby contribute to biodiversity conservation strategies. Alnitak focuses most of its research efforts into providing baseline scientific data for the adoption of management measures that should make fisheries sustainability, economic development and biodiversity conservation compatible. For this reason, Alnitak and its researchers have participated in useful and important projects such as LIFE02NAT/E/8610, SCANS II, CODA and NECESSITY. The research team of Alnitak has wide experience in research fields such as: the bioacoustics applied to Acoustic Deterrent Devices (ADDs) and Acoustic Harassement Devices (AHDs) and especially in the development of playback experiments and the cetaceans' reactions to them; the study of populations of sea turtles and in particular the monitoring of the bycatch in longline gear, data collection onboard fishing vessels, and experimental techniques on mitigation measures; and the study of cetacean populations, in particular their abundance and habitat preferences through spatial modelling, and their conservation problems. In this sense, Alnitak has been focusing during the last years in the development of Conservation Plans and the design of Marine Protected Areas, based on robust scientific data. In addition, there is a strong tradition of cooperation and synergy among the Alnitak team and the main European and other international entities with programs devoted to these issues (e.g., NOAA Fisheries, WIDECAST, SMRU, IWC, DIFRES, ACCOBAMS, EC, IEO Spain), the main stakeholders (e.g., the longline fishing fleet) and the competent authorities in Spain (Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Fisheries). Alnitak conducts research using the research vessel Toftevaag, which has been used to carry out the cetacean and sea turtle research for more than 15 years.\n",

Standardized sampling protocols were used in all areas to minimizes biases due to sampling. The YoNAH project collected photographs of individually distinctive natural markings, genetic samples and behaviour data on humpback whales in the North Atlantic Ocean. Field work began in January 1992 with a large-scale study of humpbacks in their principal West Indies breeding range at Silver Bank, Navidad Bank and Samana Bay, Dominican Republic; and Mona Passage, Puerto Rico. During summer, sampling was conducted in all the known major North Atlantic feeding grounds: the Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, Labrador, southwestern Greenland, Iceland, and Norway.

      "Penguins are some of the most charismatic animals in the world and have captured the imaginations of news-makers, scientists, film producers and the general public. Beyond their general intrinsic value, they are considered important ecosystem indicators. That is to say, monitoring these beautiful species can tell us a lot about the general health of the Antarctic. This is because penguins are top predators, and changes (natural or anthropogenic) which influence the oceanography of the region or prey abundance, will ultimately be detected through changes in distribution or population size.\n",

      "The Antarctic is currently governed by nations which make up the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). Management strategies designed by the ATS rely on accurate and citable penguin population data in order to mitigate any anthropogenic impacts in the region. However, data on penguin populations are limited primarily due to the fact that most monitored colonies are nearby permanent research stations. This means that any remote populations are essentially ignored during planning processes. Due to advances in remote sensing, modeling and aerial imagery, it is now possible to obtain population estimates for these hard-to-reach sites.\n",

      "Methodology: Offshore transect surveys were flown twice-monthly at two different altitudes (200 ft and about 750-1,000 ft ASL) along approximately 40 east-west transect lines extending an average of 60 nm offshore. The transects sampled on a given survey were selected randomly from a set of 92 standard (predetermined) lines spaced at intervals of 5' of latitude.  Standard transects provided systematic coverage of shelf, slope, and offshore waters in the study area. Sightings of seabirds, pinnipeds, and sea otters were recorded only on low-altitude surveys. Sightings of cetaceans and turtles were recorded on both low- and high-altitude surveys. Seabird sightings were recorded only on the shaded side of the aircraft within a strip transect of 50 m width. Marine mammal and turtle sightings were recorded within an unbounded corridor on both high- and low-altitude surveys, but only the shaded side of the aircraft was searched on the low-altitude surveys. Cross-legs connecting standard transects were searched only on high-altitude surveys. Offshore cross-legs were searched on both sides of the aircraft, while only the nearshore side was searched on cross-legs along the coast. Declination angle was measured and noted for each marine mammal/turtle sightings and later used to calculate a probability density function of frequency with right-angle sighting distance. Navigation was by Loran and VLF-Omega.\n",

      "Databases produced: Three databases of sightings at sea were produced by these studies (data on numbers of seabirds and pinnipeds on land were also collected but are not addressed in the present study). These include: 1) sightings of cetaceans and turtles recorded on 36 high-altitude aerial surveys, 2) sightings of cetaceans, pinnipeds, sea otters, and turtles recorded on 36 low-altitude aerial surveys, and 3) sightings of seabirds on 36 low-altitude aerial surveys.

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The study of long-distance migration provides insights into the habits and performance of organisms at the limit of their physical abilities. The Arctic tern <i>Sterna paradisaea</i> is the epitome of such behavior; despite its small size (&lt;125 g), banding recoveries and at-sea surveys suggest that its annual migration from boreal and high Arctic breeding grounds to the Southern Ocean may be the longest seasonal movement of any animal. Our tracking of 11 Arctic terns fitted with miniature (1.4 g) geolocators revealed that these birds do indeed travel huge distances (more than 80,000 km annually for some individuals). As well as confirming the location of the main wintering region, we also identified a previously unknown oceanic stopover area in the North Atlantic used by birds from at least two breeding populations (from Greenland and Iceland). Although birds from the same colony took one of two alternative southbound migration routes following the African or South American coast, all returned on a broadly similar, sigmoidal trajectory, crossing from east to west in the Atlantic in the region of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone. Arctic terns clearly target regions of high marine productivity both as stopover and wintering areas, and exploit prevailing global wind systems to reduce flight costs on long-distance commutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "The Arctic tern is known to make the longest annual migration in the animal kingdom. During its breeding season, it is found far to the north where summer days are long, and it winters far south in the southern hemisphere, where the days are longest during November to February. This means that the Arctic tern probably experiences more sun light during a calendar year than any other creature on Earth. The long-distance travel of the Arctic tern is well-known both amongst researchers and in the broader public. Now, for the first time, technological advances allow us to follow the Arctic tern on its immense journey, practically from pole to pole.\n",

Each annual survey is approximately 100 consecutive days from early February though mid-May. (2011 was 105 days; 2012 was 98 days.) Conditions permitting, each survey-day begins at 9 AM and ends usually at 5 PM.\n",

      "Coal Oil Point Reserve in Goleta, California, USA, with GPS coordinates, 34˚24.434'N, 119˚52.701'W. The coastline runs east-west, with northbound whales traveling west, left to right across our Point towards Point Conception. We are able to track across 200 degrees from 80˚ to 280˚ magnetic. Unfortunately, facing east, south, and west, observers also track the sun across the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The observation team consists of from one to five Counters, including the Project Coordinator, up to two Supervisors, and up to two Observers. Supervisor shifts are four hours; Observer shifts are two hours; and the Project Coordinator is usually on-site all day. The Project Coordinator and/or a Supervisor is always on Counter Point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "The goals of the research are to estimate the number of gray whales and gray-whale calves migrating northbound through our corridor and to share our data to complement similar sampling-studies along the California coast. Goals of education are to teach the process of scientific research to Counters and to give them the opportunity to conduct a meaningful study, to experience marine mammals in their environment, and to share this process and their enthusiasm with the public through outreach and various media, especially the internet.\n",

      "In 2011, we made note of Off-Effort sightings of anything (marine mammals and vessels). In 2012 only Off-Effort sightings of northbound Gray whales were included in the raw data. We do not include Off-Effort data when creating an estimate of the Gray whales in migration. We do keep them in the record of sightings.\n",
      "It is rare for us to be able to distinguish species for Common dolphins: <i>Delphinus capensis</i> (Long-beaked) or <i>Delphinus delpus</i> (Short-beaked). Occasionally they will come close enough and with the conditions good enough, and we may get an image that will determine species.\n",
      "Northbound and southbound Gray whales are the same species, but migrating in different directions. Our targets are northbound Gray whales.\n",
      "There are many California sea lions in our area, in the water close to shore, traveling offshore, resting on buoys, and occasionally on the sand, sick or injured. We do not usually enter sightings of California sea lions, except if they are sick or injured and onshore or they are in exceptionally large groups or involved in a vessel interaction.\n",

      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "This research addresses three broad areas:\n",
      "1. Odontocete stock structure. This involves examination of residency and inter-island movements of individuals using photo-identification and satellite- and VHF-radio tagging, and population structure using genetic markers (from skin biopsies). We have photo-identification catalogs of 11 species: bottlenose dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, spinner dolphins, false killer whales, killer whales, melon-headed whales, short-finned pilot whales, pygmy killer whales, Cuvier's beaked whales, Blainville's beaked whales, and dwarf sperm whales, and have added photographs taken over the last 20 years of individuals of a number of species off the island of Hawai'i, collected by Dan McSweeney of the Wild Whale Research Foundation. Photographs of sperm whales are also contributed to a catalog at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center. In April 2006, we began deployments of long-term VHF and satellite tags (based on a tag design of Dr. Russ Andrews of the University of Alaska Fairbanks) on short-finned pilot whales, false killer whales, melon-headed whales, Cuvier's beaked whales and Blainville's beaked whales, to examine movements around the islands. For molecular studies, to date (March 2012) we have collected over 1,200 genetic samples from 10 different species, and have more field work planned. These samples are being analysed by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, La Jolla, California, and by a graduate student at Oregon State University.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Odontocete population assessment. Population estimation is undertaken using mark-recapture analyses of individual photo-identification data. To date, data from bottlenose dolphins, false killer whales, rough-toothed dolphins, Cuvier's beaked whales and Blainville's beaked whales have been analyzed, and catalogs for other species are available for such analyses. Some of this work (e.g., false killer whales) is being done in collaboration with other researchers (Dan Salden of the Hawai'i Whale Research Foundation, John Durban of the National Marine Mammal Laboratory, and Mark Deakos of the Hawai'i Association for Marine Education and Research).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Diving behavior and ecology.  These studies involve using suction-cup attached tags, analyses of habitat use, and studies of trophic ecology. Habitat use is being examined looking at distribution in relation to depth and slope using ArcGIS. Studies of trophic ecology involve stable isotope and fatty acid analyses of skin samples, in collaboration with Dr. Jason Turner of the University of Hawai'i, Hilo. Tagging studies have involved deployments of time-depth recorders on short-finned pilot whales, false killer whales, pantropical spotted dolphins, Cuvier's beaked whales, Blainville's beaked whales, melon-headed whales, and humpback whales, as well as deployments of the National Geographic Crittercam system on short-finned pilot whales and false killer whales.\n",

The fieldwork platform was a high-wing aircraft (“push-pull” Cessna 337) flying at an altitude of 152 m (500 ft) and at a groundspeed of approximately 166 km/h (90 knots). Two observers, positioned on each side of the aircraft, scanned the sea surface and a recorder took note of data reported: species, number of animals, location (obtained from a GPS), time, and environmental conditions, including Beaufort sea state. Environmental conditions were updated whenever changes occurred and GPS provided a continuous record of position (updated every few seconds).

      "Visual line-transect surveys for cetaceans were conducted in the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) in association with a NOAA/Alaska Fisheries Science Center’s pollock stock assessment survey aboard the NOAA ship Miller Freeman (2002 and 2004) and the NOAA ship Oscar Dyson (2008 and 2010). In 2002 and 2004, the surveys were a continuation of those done in 1999 and 2000, taking advantage of the survey platform as it ran transects through SEBS. In 2008 and 2010, the cetacean survey was included as part of the Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program, a NPRB funded project to  test and improve our understanding of effects of climate change and management actions on the Bering Sea ecosystem. Methods in all years were the same with three observers rotating through two 25x (Big Eye) binocular positions and one recorder on the flying bridge. Survey effort was conducted along the pollock survey transect lines, weather permitting.  Additional effort was conducted while in transit to and from pollock survey waypoints. Transect survey effort was 3,761 km in 2002, 1,692 km in 2004 (observers were present for only half of the survey), 3,255 km in 2008 and 1,681 km in 2010. The following cetacean species were recorded: fin whale (<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>), sei whale (<i>Balaenoptera borealis</i>), minke whale (<i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i>), humpback whale (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>), gray whale (<i>Eschrichtius robustus</i>), sperm whale (<i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>), Baird’s beaked whale (<i>Berardius bairdii</i>), Stejneger’s beaked whale (<i>Mesoplodon stejnegeri</i>), killer whale (<i>Orcinus orca</i>), Pacific white-sided dolphin (<i>Lagenorhynchus obliquidens</i>), Dall’s porpoise (<i>Phocoenoides dalli</i>), and harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>). Pinniped species were also recorded to include the Steller sea lion (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) and the northern fur seal (<i>Callorhinus ursinus</i>), as well as the sea otter (<i>Enhydra lutris</i>).  Fin whales were the most common large whale, and Dall's porpoises were the most common small cetacean. Distribution, abundance estimates and population trends for fin, humpback, and minke whales, and Dall’s and harbor porpoise are currently being analyzed.\n",

      "Methodology: Aerial and ship surveys were conducted along pre-established transects designed to systematically sample marine mammal and seabird abundance in all waters of the study area. Aerial surveys were conducted at two altitudes (200 ft and about 750-1,000 ft ASL) alternating at 2-3 week intervals.  Seabirds and pinnipeds were recorded only on the low-altitude surveys which predominantly sampled along eight lines of latitude, separated by 25 nm, and connecting lines of longitude. High-altitude surveys sampled cetacean abundance along 15 Loran lines oriented northeast-southwest and separated by 12-15 nm. On low-altitude surveys, seabirds were counted only within a 50 m corridor on the shaded side of the aircraft. Marine mammals were counted in an unbounded corridor on one side of the aircraft on low-altitude surveys and both sides of the aircraft on high-altitude surveys. A clinometer or marks on the wing-strut were used to estimate the declination, and the measurement or estimate later used to calculate probability density functions of frequency with right-angle distance. Ships were used for surveys of inshore waters along standard (i.e., predetermined and replicate) transects and for search, catch, and tagging/tracking of small cetaceans. The standard ship transect cruises sampled abundance of seabirds and marine mammals over banks, basins, and ridges in waters inshore of the Patton Escarpment (the shelf break). Seabirds and marine mammals were counted on both sides of the cruise track and distance estimated or measured with a range-finder. Catch cruises attempted to find and remain with schools of common dolphin and other small cetaceans; therefore, data on sightings from these cruises cannot be used as samples of animal abundance. The Southern California Bight Study also included ground and aerial censuses of pinniped and seabird colonies, and special studies of productivity, mortality rates, and foraging range. \n",

      "Sizing Ocean Giants Records: 1237\n",
      "What are the greatest sizes that the largest marine megafauna obtain? This is a simple question with a difficult and complex answer. Many of the largest-sized species occur in the world’s oceans. For many of these, rarity, remoteness, and quite simply the logistics of measuring these giants has made obtaining accurate size measurements difficult. Inaccurate reports of maximum sizes run rampant through the scientific literature and popular media. Moreover, how intraspecific variation in the body sizes of these animals relates to sex, population structure, the environment, and interactions with humans remains underappreciated. Here, we review and analyze body size for 25 ocean giants ranging across the animal kingdom. For each taxon we document body size for the largest known marine species of several clades. We also analyze intraspecific variation and identify the largest known individuals for each species. Where data allows, we analyze spatial and temporal intraspecific size variation. We also provide allometric scaling equations between different size measurements as resources to other researchers. In some cases, the lack of data prevents us from fully examining these topics and instead we specifically highlight these deficiencies and the barriers that exist for data collection. Overall, we found considerable variability in intraspecific size distributions from strongly left- to strongly right-skewed. We provide several allometric equations that allow for estimation of total lengths and weights from more easily obtained measurements. In several cases, we also quantify considerable geographic variation and decreases in size likely attributed to humans.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The whimbrel is a large, holarctic, highly migratory shorebird.  The North American race includes two disjunct breeding populations both of which winter primarily in Central and South America.  The western population breeds in Alaska and the Northwest Territories of Canada.  The eastern population breeds south and west of Hudson Bay in Manitoba and Ontario.  It has generally been believed that the western population follows a Pacific Coast migration route between breeding and wintering areas and that the Hudson Bay population follows an Atlantic Coast route.  Both populations are of high conservation concern due to dramatic declines in recent decades. For more than a decade, scientists have believed that the seaside of the lower Delmarva Peninsula in Virginia played a significant role in the life cycle of the whimbrel.  During spring migration in the mid-1990s, Bryan Watts from the Center for Conservation Biology at the College of William and Mary and Barry Truitt of The Nature Conservancy documented the densest concentration of whimbrels ever recorded in the western hemisphere within the barrier island lagoon system of the lower Delmarva Peninsula.  Since that time, it has been believed that the Eastern Shore of Virginia represents a critical, coastal staging area where birds feed on the staggering numbers of fiddler crabs that inhabit the lagoon system and build up energy reserves before making their last overland flight to the breeding grounds.  However, it has always been assumed that the birds staging along the lower Delmarva were exclusively from the Hudson Bay population.  The flight documented in spring 2008 (see Winnie's map) has forced a change in thinking regarding the origin of birds using this stopover site.   Beginning in 2008, the Center for Conservation Biology  collaborated with The Nature Conservancy to investigate the stopover ecology of whimbrels along the Delmarva Peninsula.  The study includes aerial surveys to estimate seasonal numbers, traditional transmitters to examine stopover periods, and satellite transmitters to document migration pathways and breeding destinations for birds leaving the site. The seaside of the Delmarva Peninsula has been recognized as a globally important bird area, a hemispheric shorebird reserve, and a UNESCO biosphere reserve.  The discovery that whimbrels use the site as a terminal staging area before embarking on a transcontinental flight suggests that the site is uniquely suited to provide the tremendous amount of energy required to prepare birds for such a flight. Continued research planned by CCB and TNC in Virginia will investigate whimbrel stopover ecology and the broader strategic importance of this site to whimbrel populations.In 2010, Georgia Department of Natural Resources began tracking Whimbrel from another important migration stopover on the east coast of North America. Georgia's barrier island and salt-marsh complex provide excellent stopover habitat for refueling on their migration from their wintering grounds in South America to the breeding grounds in the Arctic.   Names for the Vriginia Whimbrels are landmarks near where the Whimbrel congregate on the Eastern Shore of Virginia (Hope Creek, Box Tree, Fowling Point, Elkins Marsh, Hope Creek, Indian Creek, town of Machipongo, Webb Island, Ramshorn Channel, Mill Creek, and Kitt Creek).\n",

The primary objective was to provide information to improve conservation and management plans for these species. The project used a multidisciplinary approach. For both <i>Delphinus</i> species, data were collected to estimate abundance, pregnancy and birth rates, timing of reproduction, gene flow, and contaminant concentrations. Oceanographic data were collected to characterize habitat, and data on distribution and abundance of seabirds, prey fishes, and squids were collected to further characterize the ecosystem in which these dolphins live. Photographs of dolphin schools were taken from a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft while the survey was being conducted.  The aerial photographs will provide count and measurement data to calibrate observer estimates of school size and to estimate timing of reproduction and birth rates.  This research will facilitate understanding population demography of these species in an ecosystem framework. Essential information about the primary focal species, <i>D. capensis</i>, will greatly increase our knowledge about this coastal species and the geographic extent of a Mexico-U.S. transboundary stock.

      "This 1993 line-transect survey was designed to make abundance estimates of the northern stock of common dolphin, <i>Delphinus delphis</i>, in the eastern Pacific. This stock of dolphin is taken in the tropical tuna fishery. The index of relative abundance for this stock, computed from sightings on tuna vessels, has declined substantially in the last decade.  However, because tuna vessels cover only the southern portion of the stock's range, the declines in the index may be due to a northward shift in distribution, rather than an actual decline in abundance. The 1993 survey was designed to produce the first range-wide estimates of abundance for the northern common dolphin and its recently described congener, <i>Delphinus capensis</i>. This survey was conducted by the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center aboard NOAA Ships <i>McArthur</i> and <i>David Starr Jordan</i> for a combined total of approximately 32,000 kilometers surveyed from late July to early November 1993. This dataset provides the time-date and geographical coordinates, by species/stock, of all cetaceans detected during the survey, as well as the daily and intra-daily start and end points of the line-transect survey by the NOAA Ship <i>David Starr Jordan</i>.\n",

      "Monitoring abundance and distribution is essential in any conservation strategy, but is often ignored in many regions, including much of the Mediterranean. It is a priority of the Italian Ministry of the Environment, who funded a series of aerial surveys around Italy, to provide significant baseline information on cetaceans distribution and abundance. The covered areas included the Pelagos Sanctuary, the Central Tyrrhenian, the Corsica and Sardinia Seas, and the Ionian Sea and the Gulf of Taranto. Numbers of animals within the Sanctuary are significantly higher in summer, when human activities and thus potential population level impacts are highest. A crude comparison with data from past shipboard surveys suggests an appreciable decrease in fin whale density in the Pelagos Sanctuary area over the last decade, reiterating the need for a major synoptic basinwide survey, as well as regular monitoring surveys. The low CVs and CIs reconfirm the effectiveness of aerial surveys in estimating abundance of certain cetacean species in suitable areas/circumstances and may provide a model for other areas of the Mediterranean. These surveys provide baseline data to develop efficient long-term systematic monitoring programmes, as required by a number of national and international frameworks. The collected data may also be crucial in assessing whether ship strikes, one of the main causes of death for fin whales in the Mediterranean, are affecting the Mediterranean population.\n",

Out of nine black-footed albatross tracked, two chicks died during this study. Out of sixteen Laysan albatross tracked, the eggs of seven birds did not hatch and eight chicks died during the tracking study. Due to this massive breeding failure, the satellite tracked birds abandoned their colony and dispersed widely across the North Pacific Ocean. Thus, the 1998 (central-place foraging) and 1999 (dispersal from colonies) tracking data should be considered separately.\n",

      "Greater Shearwater (Puffinus gravis), seabird  Procellariiforme, breed on Tristan da Cunha island group, remote islands midway between South Africa and South America. They complete an extensive transatlantic migration each year to reach the Northern hemisphere. They spend their wintering/staging period in productive waters such as Gulf of Maine, Georges and Grand Banks, Bay of Fundy, Greenland and Europe. While still abundant, the location of the entire world’s population on a single island group makes these birds susceptible to environmental changes.  We will be following 22 greater (or great) shearwaters equipped with Satellite tags from Gough island/ Inaccessible island (United Kingdom) to the Northern Atlantic from October 2009 to October 2010. Our first objective is tracking pre-laying exodus and foraging trips during incubation/ rearing period; second objective: identifying migration paths and finally, understanding foraging movements of these birds over the Northwest Atlantic until molt period. Greater shearwaters have been observed feeding over tuna school during ship surveys since they share same prey type; subsequently, we will overlay shearwater tracks and tunas distribution to search for evidence of spatial co-occurrence between these 2 top predators to evaluate the importance of this mutual association.This project is a collaboration between Dr Rob Ronconi (University of Dalhousie/ Halifax/ Canada), Marie C Martin and Dr Richard R. Veit (College of Staten Island/ City University of New York/ USA) supported by US Wildlife Fisheries Service, as well as David and Lucile Packard Grant (Birdlife International / Agreement for Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels).

      "We examined bottlenose dolphin <i>Tursiops truncatus</i> community structure and abundance in the northeast Gulf of Mexico coastal waters stretching from St. Vincent Sound to Alligator Harbor, Florida, USA. Photographic-identification surveys were conducted between May 2004 and October 2006 to gain an  understanding of dolphin distribution in this region. Dolphins were distributed year-round throughout the region; however, individual sighting records indicate that 2 parapatric dolphin communities exist. We conducted mark-recapture surveys using photographic-identification techniques to estimate the abundance of dolphins inhabiting the 2 areas these communities reside in: St. Vincent Sound/Apalachicola Bay, western; and St. George Sound/Alligator Harbor, eastern. Sighting records of individual dolphins from 2004 to 2008 support the existence of 2 communities in these areas; only 3.5% of distinctive dolphins photographed were seen in both western and eastern areas. The 2 communities differ in their structure: the eastern area supports a more transient population with 45.7% of distinctive dolphins photo graphed only once compared with 28.3% in the west. Independent estimates of abundance (N, 95% CI = [low, high]) were calculated using the Chapman modification of the Lincoln-Petersen method for June 2007 and for January and February 2008 for the eastern area (242 [141−343], 395 [273−516]) and for the western survey area (197 [130−264], 111 [71−150]), respectively. Our results serve as a baseline that can be used by the US National Marine Fisheries Service to manage bottlenose dolphins in this region.\n",

      "There are some discrepancies between the sighting totals in the GOALS II project report and this GIS dataset. For example, the report lists 91 humpback whale sightings (295 count) on-effort, and 15 sightings (36 count) off-effort, while this dataset contains 92 sightings (296 count) on-effort, and 19 sightings (250 count) off-effort. The reason for this discrepancy is that a large non-cohesive group of humpbacks was encountered and individual perpendicular distances could not be estimated for each of the subgroups. The first approach was to stay on effort and complete a “total count” estimate for whales in a specific quadrant until the ship had gone through the majority of the animals. Once completed, it was agreed that perpendicular estimation was needed for every subgroup of whales and the ship altered course and reran the trackline in the opposite direction for observers to get position fixes on as many of the animals/subgroups as possible. On the second pass, the density of whales was not as high and thus the numbers may have differed when compared to the first pass that was ultimately adjusted to be an “off-effort” sighting. Minor discrepancies also exist in sighting counts for other species, in most cases this is the result of how resightings were recorded (instances where the same animal group was observed more than once).\n",

Aerial transects covered 15,802 km in good/moderate conditions (&lt;= Beaufort 3) in an area of 364,371 km2. Thirteen cetacean species were recorded; abundance was estimated for harbour porpoise (375,358; CV = 0.197), bottlenose dolphin (16,485; CV = 0.422), white-beaked dolphin (16,536; CV = 0.303), short-beaked common dolphin (56,221; CV = 0.234) and minke whale (18,958; CV = 0.347). Abundance in 2005 was similar to that estimated in July 1994 for harbour porpoise, white-beaked dolphin and minke whale in a comparable area. However, model-based density surfaces showed a marked difference in harbour porpoise distribution between 1994 and 2005. Our results allow EU Member States to discharge their responsibilities under the Habitats Directive and inform other international organisations concerning the assessment of conservation status of cetaceans and the impact of bycatch at a large spatial scale. The lack of evidence for a change in harbour porpoise abundance in EU waters as a whole does not exclude the possibility of an impact of bycatch in some areas. Monitoring bycatch and estimation of abundance continue to be essential.\n",

      "Based on a review of the literature, complemented by original observations at sea made by the authors during the past 34 years, the cetacean fauna in the Red Sea appears to be composed by a total of 16 species: three Mysticetes (Bryde’s whale, Balaenoptera edeni; Omura’s whale, B. omurai; and humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae) and 13 Odontocetes (dwarf sperm whale, Kogia sima; killer whale, Orcinus orca; false killer whale, Pseudorca crassidens; short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus; Risso’s dolphin, Grampus griseus; Indian Ocean humpback dolphin, Sousa plumbea; rough-toothed dolphin, Steno bredanensis; Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops aduncus; common bottlenose dolphin, T. truncatus; pantropical spotted dolphin, Stenella attenuata; spinner dolphin, S. longirostris; striped dolphin, S. coeruleoalba; Indo-Pacific common dolphin, Delphinus delphis tropicalis). This review presents the very first documented and confirmed sightings of B. omurai, K. sima and S. bredanensis in the Red Sea. Of all the above species, however, only nine (Bryde’s whale, false killer whale, Risso’s dolphin, Indian Ocean humpback dolphin, Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, common bottlenose dolphin, pantropical spotted dolphin, spinner dolphin, and Indo-Pacific common dolphin) appeared to occur regularly in the Red Sea, the remaining seven only occurring sporadically as vagrants from the Indian Ocean. Even regular species appeared not to be uniformly distributed throughout the Red Sea, e.g., with Indo-Pacific common dolphins mostly limited to the southern portion of the region, and the Gulf of Suez only hosting the two bottlenose dolphin species and Indian Ocean humpback dolphins. No convincing evidence was found of the Red Sea occurrence of two whale species mentioned in the literature: the common minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, and the sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus. The absence from the region of deep diving species (e.g., Ziphiidae and the sperm whale) can be explained by the geomorphology of the Straits of Bab al Mandab, with its extended shallow sill likely to discourage incursions by such species into the Red Sea. The coordinated effort and the different expertise of the authors has contributed to amend previous mistakes and inaccuracies, verify and validate specimen identification, highlight features of relevance for species taxonomy and, most importantly, draw a fundamental baseline to inform conservation of cetaceans in the Red Sea.\n",

The survey used line transect sampling methods and purpose built data collection equipment designed to minimise bias in estimates of abundance.

The belly window observer was limited to a 28 deg view on both sides of the trackline and these sightings were recorded as the degrees right or left. \n",

On days when the flight would return to the same airport and personal luggage was not transported additional fuel could be carried and survey days of 6 hours were possible. On days when transiting to a new location, flight duration was limited to approximately 5 hours.

      "Methodology: Aerial and ship surveys were conducted along pre-established transects designed to systematically sample marine mammal and seabird abundance in all waters of the study area. Aerial surveys were conducted at two altitudes (200 ft and about 750-1,000 ft ASL) alternating at 2-3 week intervals. Seabirds and pinnipeds were recorded only on the low-altitude surveys which predominantly sampled along eight lines of latitude, separated by 25 nm, and connecting lines of longitude. High-altitude surveys sampled cetacean abundance along 15 Loran lines oriented northeast-southwest and separated by 12-15 nm. On low-altitude surveys, seabirds were counted only within a 50 m corridor on the shaded side of the aircraft. Marine mammals were counted in an unbounded corridor on one side of the aircraft on low-altitude surveys and both sides of the aircraft on high-altitude surveys. A clinometer or marks on the wing-strut were used to estimate the declination, and the measurement or estimate later used to calculate probability density functions of frequency with right-angle distance. Ships were used for surveys of inshore waters along standard (i.e., predetermined and replicate) transects and for search, catch, and tagging/tracking of small cetaceans. The standard ship transect cruises sampled abundance of seabirds and marine mammals over banks, basins, and ridges in waters inshore of the Patton Escarpment (the shelf break). Seabirds and marine mammals were counted on both sides of the cruise track and distance estimated or measured with a range-finder. Catch cruises attempted to find and remain with schools of common dolphin and other small cetaceans; therefore, data on sightings from these cruises cannot be used as samples of animal abundance. The Southern California Bight Study also included ground and aerial censuses of pinniped and seabird colonies, and special studies of productivity, mortality rates, and foraging range. \n",

      "There has been very little research on marine mammals in Cuban waters. Much of the information on marine mammals in this region is buried in historical and gray literature. In order to provide a comprehensive account of marine mammal occurrence in Cuba’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), we reviewed and verified 659 published and unpublished sighting, stranding, capture, and tagging records. Eighteen extant species and four genera have confirmed records for Cuban EEZ waters. This includes 17 species of cetaceans (three baleen whales and 14 toothed whales) and one sirenian species. An additional 11 cetacean species and one extant pinniped species have been reported, but not confirmed, or may have the potential to occur in Cuban waters. Historical records of the Caribbean monk seal (<i>Monachus tropicalis</i>) are documented in Cuba; however, this species is now considered extinct. The only two species that are seen regularly and considered common in Cuban nearshore waters are the common bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) and the West Indian manatee (<i>Trichechus manatus</i>).\n",

      "In spring 1993, the Alaskan panhandle and Prince William Sound were surveyed for harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) from the NOAA John N. Cobb using line-transect methodology.  The shipboard platform was 28.36 m (93 ft) in length with a bridge height of 4.27 m (14 ft). To obtain data on seasonal movements of porpoise, a limited number of transects were made in areas of known porpoise concentrations. When a sighting was made, the following variables were recorded: time, angle, number of reticles to the sighting, radar distance (nm) to the shoreline at the same angle of the sighting, the species, the count of the porpoise seen (best, high, and low), and the animal(s) direction of travel. Search effort was recoded by noting the time and location of the ship at the beginning and end of each transect.\n",

      "Purpose:\n",
      "Although harbor porpoises, <i>Phocoena phocoena</i>, are known to occur throughout Alaska waters, few estimates of abundance exist. In 1991, the National Marine Mammal Laboratory initiated a 3 year study on Alaska harbor porpoises. The objectives of this program were to: \n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "This 1993 line-transect survey was designed to make abundance estimates of the northern stock of common dolphin, <i>Delphinus delphis</i>, in the eastern Pacific. This stock of dolphin is taken in the tropical tuna fishery. The index of relative abundance for this stock, computed from sightings on tuna vessels, has declined substantially in the last decade. However, because tuna vessels cover only the southern portion of the stock's range, the declines in the index may be due to a northward shift in distribution, rather than an actual decline in abundance. The 1993 survey was designed to produce the first range-wide estimates of abundance for the northern common dolphin and its recently described congener, <i>Delphinus capensis</i>. This survey was conducted by the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center aboard NOAA Ships <i>McArthur</i> and <i>David Starr Jordan</i> for a combined total of approximately 32,000 kilometers surveyed from late July to early November 1993. This dataset provides the time-date and geographical coordinates, by species/stock, of all cetaceans detected during the survey, as well as the daily and intra-daily start and end points of the line-transect survey by the NOAA Ship <i>McArthur</i>.\n",

      "In summer 1993, the Alaskan panhandle and Prince William Sound were surveyed for harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) from the NOAA John N. Cobb using line transect methodology.  The shipboard platform was 28.36 m (93 ft) in length with a bridge height of 4.27 m (14 ft). To obtain data on seasonal movements of porpoise, a limited number of transects were made in areas of known porpoise concentrations. When a sighting was made, the following variables were recorded: time, angle, number of reticles to the sighting, radar distance (nm) to the shoreline at the same angle of the sighting, the species, the count of the porpoise seen (best, high, and low), and the animal(s) direction of travel. Search effort was recoded by noting the time and location of the ship at the beginning and end of each transect.\n",

The objective of this project is to use satellite telemetry to study and analyze the at-sea movements of female turtles, both during and following the nesting season, for the most threatened species that occur along the Brazilian coast (Caretta caretta, Dermochelys coriacea, Eretmochelys imbricata and Lepdochelys olivacea). The project will involve the deployment of 40 satellite tags: 15 on hawksbill turtles, 5 on leatherback turtles, 10 on loggerhead turtles and 10 on olive ridley turtles. The project officially began on February 02nd, 2005 when 15 satellite tags (KiwiSat 101 from Sirtrack Limited) were attached to the carapaces of hawksbill turtles that had just finished nesting on beaches along the northern coast of Bahia, Brazil. In continuity to this Study, 03 transmitters KiwiSat 101(with capacity to work for up to 450 days) were installed in females of the species Dermochelys coriacea (leatherback sea turtle) in Espirito Santo, only reproductive area of this species in the Brazilian coast. The last species that received  transmitters was the Caretta caretta (loggerhead sea turtle), in the coast of Bahia, and Lepidochelys olivacea (olive ridley sea turtle), in the north coast of Sergipe, in the  February of 2006.

      "Satellite telemetry data from 17 juvenile loggerhead turtles (43.5-66.5 cm straight carapace length) were used in conjunction with oceanographic data to analyze the influence of regional and seasonal oceanography on dive behavior in the North Pacific Ocean. Combined dive behavior for all individuals showed that turtles spent more than 80% of their time at 0-5 m depths, and more than 90% of their time at 0-15 m depths. Multivariate classifications of dive data revealed four major dive types, three representing deeper, longer dives, and one representing shallower dives shorter in duration. Turtles exhibited variability in these dive types across oceanographic regions, with deeper, longer dives in the Hawaii longline swordfish fishing grounds during the first quarter of the year, as well as in the Kuroshio Extension Bifurcation Region and the region near the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. Turtles in the Kuroshio Extension Bifurcation Region also exhibited dive variability associated with mesoscale eddy features, with turtles making deeper, longer dives while associated with the strongest total kinetic energy. Turtles in the central North Pacific exhibited seasonality in dive behavior that appeared to reflect synchronous latitudinal movements with the North Pacific Subtropical Front and the associated seasonal, large-scale oceanography. Turtles made deeper, longer dives during the first quarter of the year within this region, the reported time and area where the highest loggerhead bycatch occurs by the longline fishery. These results represent the first comprehensive study of dive data for this species in this region. The increased understanding of juvenile loggerhead dive behavior and the influences of oceanography on dive variability should provide further insight into why interactions with longline fisheries occur and suggest methods for reducing the bycatch of this threatened species.\n",

      "A satellite tracking study was conducted on juvenile loggerhead sea turtles in the Indian Ocean. Eighteen individuals were fitted with transponders and tracked from Réunion Island (21.2°S, 55.3°E) in order to investigate movements and diving patterns. Nine turtles swam north towards Oman (20.5°N, 58.8°E), where one of the world’s largest rookeries of loggerheads is located. Three individuals travelled south towards South-Africa and Madagascar, countries that also host loggerhead nesting grounds. Fourteen of the transmitters relayed diving profiles. A dichotomy between diurnal and nocturnal diving behavior was observed. A greater number of shorter dives occurred during the day. Diving behavior also differed according to movement behavior as individuals spent more time in subsurface waters (&lt;10 m) during transit phases. The study provides an improved understanding of the oceanic movements and diving behavior of juvenile loggerheads. The results address a significant gap in the understanding of loggerhead oceanic movements and may help with the conservation of the species.\n",

      "In spring 1992, Southeast Alaska, the south side of the Alaskan Peninsula, and the Kodiak Archipelago were surveyed for harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) from the NOAA John N. Cobb using line transect methodology. The shipboard platform was 28.36 m (93 ft) in length with a bridge height of 4.27 m (14 ft). To obtain data on seasonal movements of porpoise, a limited number of transects were made in areas of known porpoise concentrations. When a sighting was made, the following variables were recorded: time, angle, number of reticles to the sighting, radar distance (nm) to the shoreline at the same angle of the sighting, the species, the count of the porpoise seen (best, high, and low), and the animal(s) direction of travel. Search effort was recoded by noting the time and location of the ship at the beginning and end of each transect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "Although harbor porpoises, <i>Phocoena phocoena</i>, are known to occur throughout Alaska waters, few estimates of abundance exist. In 1991, the National Marine Mammal Laboratory initiated a 3 year study on Alaska harbor porpoises. The objectives of this program were to: \n",
      "1) Obtain minimum population estimates in coastal waters using line transect methodology with a coefficient of variation for density estimates of less than 30% for each survey area, and \n",
      "2) Establish a baseline for detecting changes in abundance through time, for analysis of trends. \n",

This regulation requires plans observation on vessels over 15 meters operating in pelagic trawl or large vertical opening in ICES zones VI, VII, VIII and IX, and vessesl over 15 meters operating with set nets in ICES VIa, VI-a,b and VIIIa,b,c and IX.The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Directorate of Marine Fisheries and Aquaculture - DPMA) is responsible for the implementation of the Regulation for France. An observation program of incidental catches of cetaceans started in 2006 on the French metropolitan coast. The sampling plan provides coverage of 5% of the fishing effort for gillnets over 15 m in area VIII. For pelagic trawlers over 15m, a 5% coverage of the fishing effort has also been planned except for VI, VII and VIII where a coverage of 10% is required from December 1 to March 31.In addition, for vessels under 15m, pilot projects have been implemented by using on board observers. For simple pelagic trawls, a coverage rate of 5% of the fishing effort has been applied. For netters, a 1% coverage of the fishing effort has been targeted.\n",

The Terra Nova Expedition, named after its supply ship, was a private venture, financed by public contributions augmented by a government grant. It had further backing from the Admiralty, which released experienced seamen to the expedition, and from the Royal Geographical Society. As well as its polar attempt, the expedition carried out a comprehensive scientific programme. The biologist in charge of operations on the ship was Mr. D. G. Lillie, M.A., to whose skill and energy the large and valuable marine collections are mainly due. On the outward and homeward voyages from England to New Zealand fine-meshed tow-nets were put overboard whenever possible, and seventy plankton samples were obtained; in addition two hauls were made with the trawl, one near the Falklands, at a depth of 125 fathoms, and one off Rio de Janeiro, at a depth of 40 fathoms. The winter cruise (July 10th to October 10th, 1911) round the Three Kings Islands and to the north of New Zealand produced biological results of great importance; eighty plankton samples were obtained, and the seven hauls made with trawl and dredge at depths of 15 to 300 fathoms revealed a bottom-fauna of extraordinary variety, including a great number of forms new to science. Between New Zealand and McMurdo Sound one hundred and thirty-five samples of plankton and fifty of muds and oozes were obtained; in the Ross Sea and in McMurdo Sound fifteen rich hauls with the trawl, at depths of 40 to 300 fathoms, produced a collection which has added greatly to our knowledge of the Antarctic marine fauna.\n",

The sanctuary protects 842 square miles (638 square nautical miles) of open ocean, overlaying a diverse seafloor topography and array of benthic and pelagic habitats that support biological communities broadly representative of the GoM. The sanctuary’s mission is to conserve, protect and enhance the biological diversity, ecological integrity and cultural legacy of the sanctuary while facilitating uses that are compatible with the primary goal of resource protection.  When Congress designated the sanctuary in 1992, it did so to recognize the nationally significant conservation and aesthetic qualities of the site. Congress directed that the sanctuary be managed to maintain the habitats and ecological services of the natural assemblage of living resources of the area, as well as its maritime heritage resources. The Stellwagen Bank sanctuary is the only federal entity to conserve biological diversity and protect maritime heritage resources in the offshore waters of the GoM.\n",

The atoll encloses a brackish lagoon whose shallow waters are the home to a population of bottlenose dolphins. To date more than a 175 dolphins have been identified in this region through photo-identification methods on surveys and follows.

The most recent national population estimate dates back to the breeding season in 1978 and did not cover the entire coastline. Reliable up-to-date information on the abundance and distribution of harbor seals in Ireland is necessary to assess the conservation status of the species and for the effective identification, management and monitoring of special areas of conservation required for harbor seals under the European Union Habitats Directive. To provide comprehensive current information on Ireland's harbor seal population, a geographically extensive survey was conducted along the coastline of the Republic of Ireland during the species' annual moult in August 2003. This complemented a similar survey of Northern Ireland, which was conducted in 2002. Using thermal imaging technology, haul-out groups of harbor seals and grey seals <i>Halichoerus grypus</i> were identified from the air, aerial-counts were obtained and compared with simultaneous ground-count data from selected sites. Harbor seal distribution recorded during the 2003 moult season was concentrated in the south-west, west and north-west of the country. This national survey yielded a minimum population estimate for the Republic of Ireland of 2905 harbor seals, delivering an effective baseline for current and future population research.\n",

A total of 8,522 km were surveyed in a Dehavilland Twin Otter at 152.5 m (500 ft) altitude and 185 km/hr (100 kts). Two overlapping sawtooth lines were designed along the coastline of Bristol Bay.  Both sides of each sawtooth were approximately 37 km with a 46 km base. Large bays were also included in the survey. Primary observers searched through bubble windows on the left and right sides of the aircraft and reported sightings to a computer operator. To estimate a perception bias correction factor for this study, an independent observer was added at a belly window position to determine the number of animals in the immediate vicinity of the trackline that were missed by the primary observers. There were 215 sightings of harbor porpoise (260 individuals), 12 Dall's porpoise (24 individuals), and 16 Pacific white-sided dolphins (170 individuals) while surveying tracklines. Additional cetacean sightings included 12 gray whales (13 individuals), 18 humpback whales (29 individuals), 8 minke whales (13 individuals), and 3 killer whales (11 individuals).\n",

      "Visual line-transect surveys for cetaceans were conducted in the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) from 10 June to 3 July 2000, in association with a pollock stock assessment survey aboard the NOAA ship Miller Freeman. Observers scanned for cetaceans with 25x (Big Eye) binoculars from the flying bridge (platform height = 12 m) at survey speeds of 18.5-22 km h-1 (10-12 knots). Transect survey effort was 2,194 km in 2000, in a study area 158,561 km2. An additional 402 km of trackline was surveyed in 2000 while in transit to or from pollock survey way points. Fin whales (<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>) were the most common large whale, and Dall's porpoises (<i>Phocoenoides dalli</i>) were the most common small cetacean. In the SEBS 2000, uncorrected abundance estimates were: 683 (CV = 0.32) fin whales, 102 (CV = 0.50) humpback whales (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>), 1,003 (CV = 0.26) minke whales, 9,807 (CV = 0.20) Dall's porpoise, and 1,958 (CV = 0.21) harbor porpoise. Non-pollock echosigns observed near cetaceans, some of which may have been cetacean prey, were not routinely identified during trawl sampling because the research focus was on pollock abundance assessment. Clearly, additional surveys and concomitant assessment of cetacean prey are needed to better define their role in the Bering Sea ecosystem. Such surveys, combined with measures of local hydrography and prey field should be the goal of future cetacean assessments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "Cetacean distribution and abundance in the Bering Sea is poorly described, with even recent reviews of cetaceans' role in the ecosystem reliant on data from the commercial whaling era. Commercial harvests of baleen whales (mysticetes) were extensive in the North Pacific and Bering Sea, especially between 1835 and 1850 for North Pacific right whales and between 1965 and 1979 for fin and humpback whales. The effect of these large-scale removals on the marine ecosystem is largely unknown. Similarly, some species of toothed whales (odontocetes) are sometimes killed in the course of commercial fishing operations. Pelagic dolphins and Dall's porpoise were especially vulnerable during high seas driftnet fishing in the North Pacific in the 1980s, and once again the long-term ramifications of these removals are unknown. One reason for this uncertainty is the lack of data on current cetacean distribution and estimates of abundance in pelagic environments. Surveys to determine distribution and abundance are costly and, therefore, often confined either to coastal waters where the logistics are most practical, or to areas of the ocean where marine mammal mortality associated with commercial fishing is particularly high. The pelagic waters of the Bering Sea have not met either criteria and so are comparatively undersampled for cetaceans. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cruises were undertaken in association with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center/Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (AFSC/RACE) division to conduct visual surveys for cetaceans during the semi-annual acoustic trawl surveys for walleye pollock (<i>Theragra chalcogramma</i>) on the Bering Sea shelf. Biologists from the AFSC/National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) were able to join subsequent surveys in the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) in 2000, providing an opportunity to describe cetacean distribution and calculate abundance over a broad area of the Bering Sea shelf.\n",

We analyzed sightings from aerial surveys over 6 upwelling seasons (2001–02 to 2006–07) to assess within-season patterns of blue whale habitat selection, distribution, and relative abundance. Habitat variables were modelled using a general linear model (GLM) that ranked sea surface temperature (SST) and sea\n",
      "surface chlorophyll (SSC) of equal importance, followed by depth, distance to shore, SSC gradient, distance to shelf break, and SST gradient. Further discrimination by hierarchical partitioning indicated that SST accounted for 84.4% of variation in blue whale presence explained by the model, and\n",

The shipboard platform was 28.36 m (93 ft) in length with a bridge height of 4.27 m (14 ft). To obtain data on seasonal movements of porpoise, a limited number of transects were made in areas of known porpoise concentrations. When a sighting was made, the following variables were recorded: time, angle, number of reticles to the sighting, radar distance (nm) to the shoreline at the same angle of the sighting, the species, the count of the porpoise seen (best, high, and low), and the animal(s) direction of travel.

      "We are attaching satellite transmitters to loggerheads, green and Kemp's ridley sea turtles to examine interaction between the turtles and commercial fisheries in North Carolina. Turtles are commonly caught in fishing gear in the sounds of North Carolina, particularly in the fall months when both turtles and flounder are migrating to the ocean. Gill nets, in particular, have been implicated in large mortality events and as a result this type of fishing gear has been restricted to certain parts of Pamlico Sound. In addition, the fall flounder gill net fishery has been closed prematurely in the past few years due to observed mortalities of turtles. We are studying interactions between turtles and gill nets by tracking the movements of turtles in and around Pamlico Sound during the fall flounder season and comparing the distribution of turtles with that of gill nets. In addition, we hope to gain valuable life history information by following the migration patters of individuals. We work closely with researchers from the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries, in this program.

      "The oceanic movements of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), green turtles (Chelonia mydas), and a Pacific ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) were monitored with satellite telemetry between 1996 and 2001 in the Pacific Ocean. During this time several turtles migrated across the Pacific Ocean, covering more than 11,500 km between Santa Rosaliita, Baja California, Mexico (28 40N, 114 14W), and Sendai Bay, Japan (37 54N, 140 56E). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that loggerheads feeding in the eastern Pacific eventually return to nest on western Pacific beaches. Baja California loggerhead turtles have been shown, through molecular genetic analysis (Bowen et al. 1995) and flipper tag returns (Uchida and Teruya 1988, Resendiz et al. 1998), to be primarily of Japanese origin. We conclude that loggerhead turtles are capable of transpacific migrations and propose that the band of water between 25 and 30 degrees North latitude, the Subtropical Frontal Zone, may be an important transpacific migratory corridor. Recent findings (Polovina et al. 2000) indicate that juvenile loggerheads in the North Pacific move westward against weak (0.1-0.3 km/hr) eastward geostrophic currents, demonstrating that passive drift may not entirely explain the dispersal of loggerheads.Juvenile loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, in the 20 - 85 cm straight carapace length (SCL) size range have been observed in the offshore waters along the Pacific coast of California, USA, and the Baja California peninsula, Mexico (Pitman 1990, Nichols, in press). Bartlett (1989) suggested that these turtles might be of western Pacific origin, migrating 10,000 km and feeding on pelagic red crabs (Pleuroncodes planipes) along the Baja California coast. Subsequently, Pacific loggerheads appear to utilize the entire North Pacific during the course of development in a manner similar to Atlantic loggerheads' use of the Atlantic Ocean (Bolten et al. 1998). After a period of more than 10 years (Zug et al. 1995), mature turtles evidently cross the Pacific Ocean from pelagic waters and foraging areas along the Baja California coast to return to natal beaches, a journey of more than 12,000 km in each direction. This is the first effort to document pelagic movements of North Pacific loggerheads from feeding grounds to nesting areas using satellite telemetry. Previous telemetry studies of loggerhead turtles have documented post-reproductive movements (Stoneburner 1982), pelagic movements (Polovina et al. 2000), home ranges (Renaud and Carpenter 1994), navigational abilities (Papi et al. 1997) and homing behavior (Luschi 1996). However, few studies of sea turtles have documented pre-nesting movements from feeding grounds to breeding areas. Notably, Renaud and Landry (1996) documented movement of a Kemp's ridley turtle (Lepidochelys kempii) from feeding grounds in Louisiana, USA, to its successful nesting in Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. A unique opportunity to track the movements of an adult-sized loggerhead turtle, rarely encountered along the Baja California coast, emerged in 1996. The turtle had been raised in captivity and used in the initial genetic analysis of Baja California loggerhead turtles (Bowen et al., 1995). Its mature size (Kamezaki and Matsui, 1997), genetic affinities with Japanese turtles, and the existence of a previous tag return from Japanese waters of a captive-raised, Baja California loggerhead turtle (Resendiz et al., 1998) were the deciding factors in choosing this particular turtle for the study. This turtle is included in the dataset as series 7667, named Adelita. The objective of the study was to monitor the oceanic movement, using satellite telemetry, of a Pacific loggerhead turtle initially captured on feeding grounds along the Baja California coast. Movement data also were examined with respect to oceanographic and meteorological information in an effort to gain insight into the navigational cues that guide adult sea turtles and to identify possible transpacific movement corridors.\n",

      "A survey was conducted in March and April 2001, to assess the status of the Indus River dolphin, <i>Platanista gangetica minor</i>, throughout its present range. A total of 1535 km of survey effort was conducted, consisting of 1375 km of the Indus River main channel, 136 km of Indus River secondary channels, and 24 km of the Panjnad River, a tributary of the Indus. The effective range of the Indus dolphin has declined by 80% since 1870. The sum of best group size estimates produced an abundance estimate of 965 dolphins. Extrapolation of encounter rates to unsurveyed channels and application of a correction factor to account for missed dolphins indicates that the metapopulation may number approximately 1,200 individuals. Dolphins occur in five subpopulations separated by irrigation barrages. A pronounced increase in dolphin abundance and encounter rate was observed in each subsequent downstream subpopulation (except the last). The three largest subpopulations were between Chashma and Taunsa. Barrages (84 dolphins; 0.28/km), Taunsa and Guddu Barrages (259 dolphins; 0.74/km) and Guddu and Sukkur Barrages (602 dolphins; 3.60/km). Reasons suggested for the high encounter rate between Guddu and Sukkur Barrages, include high carrying capacity, low levels of anthropogenic threat, effective conservation, and augmentation of the subpopulation by downstream migration of dolphins from upstream. \n",

      "Satellite tags were attached to 34 non-reproductive loggerhead turtles (<i>Caretta caretta</i>) caught as bycatch in the Taiwanese coastal poundnet fishery from 2002 to 2008. Transmission durations ranged from 6 to 503 d (median 172 d), with 5860 d tracked in total. Horizontal track data were processed using the Bayesian state-space modelling to extract the most likely daily positions, taking into account ARGOS data quality and other forms of statistical error. A region of high occupancy in the East China Sea, covering 433 549 km2 of coastal and pelagic area next to Taiwan, China, Japan, and South Korea, was characterized from the tracking data. Various attributes of this hotspot are described using satellite tracks and remotely sensed data. The tracks were merged with oceanographic data, emphasizing a new global dataset characterizing mesoscale eddies from satellite altimetry data. A proximity-probability approach coupled with odds ratio testing was used to infer orientation to eddy features. Comparisons against random points, simulated particle tracks, and drifter buoys were used to demonstrate turtle differential responses to eddies inside and outside the hotspot, depending on eddy features (i.e. cyclonic vs. anticyclonic, edges vs. centres). Turtles inside the hotspot utilize fewer strong cyclonic eddy edges than those outside.\n",

      "Visual line-transect surveys for cetaceans were conducted in the central-eastern Bering Sea (CEBS) from 5 July to 5 August 1999, in association with a pollock stock assessment survey aboard the NOAA ship Miller Freeman. Observers scanned for cetaceans with 25x (Big Eye) binoculars form the flying bridge (platform height =  12 m) at survey speeds of 18.5-22 km h-1 (10-12 knots). Transect survey effort was 1,761 km, in a study area 196,885 km2. An additional 609 km of trackline was surveyed, while in transit to or from Pollock survey way points. Fin whales (<i>Balaeoptera physalus</i>) were the most common large whale, and Dall's porpoises (<i>Phocoenoides dalli</i>) were the most common small cetacean. In the CEBS 1999, uncorrected cetacean abundance estimates were: 3,368 (CV = 0.29) fin whales, 810 (CV = 0.36) minke whales (<i>B. acutorostrata</i>), 14,312 (CV = 0.26) Dall's porpoise, and 693 (CV = 0.53) harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>). Non-pollock echosigns observed near cetaceans, some of which may have been cetacean prey, were not routinely identified during trawl sampling because the research focus was on pollock abundance assessment. Clearly, additional surveys and concomitant assessment of cetacean prey are needed to better define their role in the Bering Sea ecosystem. Such surveys, combined with measures of local hydrography and prey field should be the goal of future cetacean assessments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "Cetacean distribution and abundance in the Bering Sea is poorly described, with even recent reviews of cetaceans' role in the ecosystem reliant on data from the commercial whaling era. Commercial harvests of baleen whales (mysticetes) were extensive in the North Pacific and Bering Sea, especially between 1835 and 1850 for North Pacific right whales and between 1965 and 1979 for fin and humpback whales. The effect of these large-scale removals on the marine ecosystem is largely unknown. Similarly, some species of toothed whales (odontocetes) are sometimes killed in the course of commercial fishing operations. Pelagic dolphins and Dall's porpoise were especially vulnerable during high seas driftnet fishing in the North Pacific in the 1980s, and once again the long-term ramifications of these removals are unknown. One reason for this uncertainty is the lack of data on current cetacean distribution and estimates of abundance in pelagic environments. Surveys to determine distribution and abundance are costly and, therefore, often confined either to coastal waters where the logistics are most practical, or to areas of the ocean where marine mammal mortality associated with commercial fishing is particularly high. The pelagic waters of the Bering Sea have not met either criteria and so are comparatively undersampled for cetaceans. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cruises were undertaken in association with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center/Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (AFSC/RACE) division to conduct visual surveys for cetaceans during the semi-annual acoustic trawl surveys for walleye pollock (<i>Theragra chalcogramma</i>) on the Bering Sea shelf. Biologists from the AFSC/National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) were able to join surveys in the central-eastern Bering Sea (CEBS) in 1999, providing an opportunity to describe cetacean distribution and calculate abundance over a broad area of the Bering Sea shelf. \n",
      "\n",
      "Provisional results of the 1999 survey in the CEBS were presented, but without clear reference to the three hydrographic domains (coastal, middle shelf, and outer shelf) that delineate oceanographic and productivity patterns in the Bering Sea. Here, we present the first estimates of cetacean abundance that can be compared between two broad pelagic zones, as well as cetacean distribution and sighting rates relative to hydrographic domains and fronts commonly referred in papers describing oceanographic processes in the eastern Bering Sea.\n",

      "In support of New York State's commitment to incorporating offshore wind into its energy portfolio, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) embarked on a multi-year ultrahigh-resolution aerial digital survey of marine resources in a 12,650 square nautical mile offshore planning area (OPA) in 2016. The OPA encompasses the waters of the New York Bight from Long Island southeast to the continental shelf break. Surveys are conducted on a quarterly basis, timed to coincide with periods of abundance of avian and marine species vulnerable to impacts from offshore wind activities. This report summarizes the results of the first two surveys conducted in July–August and November 2016. Each survey collected images covering at least 7% of the OPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the more than 700,000 images collected within the survey area during these two surveys, 3.8% (27,135 images) contained organisms, including 38 bird, 17 fish, 5 whales, 7 dolphin, 1 seal, and 4 sea turtle species. Some seasonal patterns were evident. During the summer survey, the vast majority of the organisms observed were rays (8,388 images) or birds (1,893 images). During the fall survey, birds predominated (12,352 images). Shearwaters, storm-petrels, and terns were substantially more abundant in the summer while ducks, gannets, gulls and phalaropes were substantially more abundant in the fall. Turtles, sharks, and large bony fishes were all most abundant in the summer, though present in the fall. Number of images with marine mammals was similar in both surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spatial patterns were apparent in some taxonomic groups. A number of species tended to occur in nearshore waters including large gulls and least, royal and Sterna terns. Turtles typically occurred inshore of the 70 m isobath. Audubon's, sooty, and Cory's shearwaters clustered in the northeast corner of the OPA. Whales, Audubon's shearwaters, and black-capped petrels were most common near the shelf break. While sharks exhibited no clear patterns, rays showed some tendency to cluster off the mouth of New York Harbor. Large bony fishes typically occurred in deeper waters.\n",

      "Researchers from NMML's Cetacean Assessment and Ecology Program conducted the line transect aerial surveys for harbor porpoise and Dall's porpoise from 27 May to 28 July 1998 in the Gulf of Alaska (offshore waters from Cape Suckling to Unimak Pass), Prince William Sound, and Shelikof Strait. Surveys were conducted from a NOAA Corps DeHavilland Twin Otter, flown at an altitude of 152.5 m (500 ft) and an airspeed of 185 km/hr (100 knots). Sawtooth lines were designed to cover the offshore waters from Cape Suckling to Unimak Pass (offshore of Kodiak Island) and included lines extending 15 nmi seaward, or to the 50 fathom line, whichever was farthest from shore and lines extending to the 1,000 fathom line. In Shelikof Strait a series of zigzag lines were designed between the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island. Larger inlets and bays were also included in the survey. The survey in Prince William Sound consisted of two lines: one covering the central waters and one along the coast with extensions into selected inlets. Two primary observers surveyed from a bubble window on the left and right sides of the plane. An independent observer was positioned in a belly window. This observer surveyed the trackline directly below the plane to record animals missed on the trackline by the primary observers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "A 3-year survey began in 1997 to complete a new abundance estimate by 1999. This survey will also include an abundance estimate for Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli). Once the 3 years of surveys are completed, the data will be used to estimate annual abundance of harbor porpoise and Dall's porpoise, which is one of the key pieces of information needed to manage marine mammal-fishery interactions, as required under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inclement weather restricted the completion of the entire planned survey. Survey lines were completed in Prince William Sound and an adequate number of survey miles were completed offshore from Cape Suckling west along the Kenai Peninsula, offshore of Kodiak Island, west to Sutwik Island (Alaska Peninsula), and in Shelikof Strait. A total of 49.09 survey hours were flown, with sightings of 69 harbor porpoise, 60 Dall's porpoise, 13 killer whales, 46 humpback whales, 25 fin whales, 1 Cuvier's beaked whale, 11 unidentified dolphins/porpoises, 31 unidentified whales, 21 harbor seals, 18 Steller sea lions, and 8 unidentified pinnipeds. These numbers do not include the independent bubble window observer sightings.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The North Carolina Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores began satellite tagging sea turtles it releases in 2007. The Aquarium works with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) on rescuing imperiled hatchlings. Most of the hatchlings are released as soon as they recover, but a few remain awhile longer in educational programs or exhibits. These grown turtles are outfitted with the satellite tags and released when they are between the ages of two and three years old.At that age, their carapaces are large enough to support the transmitter tags that allow their movements to be tracked. The transmitters, about three inches long, are affixed to the shells with epoxy. A saltwater cutoff switch shuts down the devices when the turtles dive, prolonging battery life. Sometimes the transmitters stop signaling for several days or weeks for unknown reasons, and then will resume operation. The lightweight, streamlined mechanisms have minimal effect on the turtles’ maneuverability. The duration of the battery determines how long the tag transmits data on the turtle locations. The time varies with each tag and turtle. Researchers and Aquarium staff use the information to learn more about sea turtles in general, and about the behavior patterns of turtles that have been rescued and reared in an aquarium setting their entire lives.The Aquarium’s sea turtle exhibits and programs are in keeping with the Aquarium’s overall mission: To inspire appreciation and conservation of North Carolina’s aquatic habitats. While at the Aquarium, rescued hatchlings are prominently exhibited in a rehabilitation room. The display, showing several tanks with recovering sea turtle hatchlings rescued from local beaches, is central to a larger sea turtle rehabilitation and education exhibit, Loggerhead Odyssey. The exhibit combines interesting facts of sea turtle biology with conservation messages through graphic panels, a large, mounted sea turtle skeleton, and a scale-model nest with hatchlings. The up-close encounters with the sea turtles on exhibit and in programs help to bring home key conservation messages to visitors. The NCWRC works with volunteers and other agencies to monitor turtle nests, rescue weak or sick hatchlings, and excavate nests when necessary. NCWRC brings the hatchlings to the Aquarium for care. Most of the hatchlings are Atlantic loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), with an occasional green turtle (Chelonia mydas). The Aquarium assists with rehabilitation and rescue of cold-stunned or injured juvenile sea turtles as well.The main goal of the Sea Turtle Awareness project is education of residents and visitors through local release and web-site tracking methods. A secondary goal is to compile a long-term data base of migratory patterns for turtles that have been raised in captivity for multiple years.\n",

      "The Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center Foundation, Inc. (VAQF) is tasked to conduct aerial surveys for the continental shelf region off the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay within the Virginia Capes Operating Area (VACAPES OPAREA) to provide marine species monitoring services. In 2007, a multi-institutional project utilizing multiple platforms (i.e., aerial, vessel, and passive acoustic monitoring) aimed at protected species monitoring off the East Coast of the United States commenced. The current survey will complement existing United States (U.S.) Navy marine species monitoring efforts (Aerial Survey Baseline Monitoring- Atlantic Fleet Training and Testing) and supports environmental planning and regulatory compliance along the East Coast of the United States. \n",
      "\n",
      "This project represents the first year of U.S. Department of the Navy-funded aerial survey efforts off Virginia Beach, Virginia. These surveys build upon previous survey efforts funded by Virginia Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program to document large whale occurrence in the vicinity of the Virginia Wind Energy Area (VA WEA) and contribute to regional mid-Atlantic ocean planning efforts. VAQF in collaboration with University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) conducted line-transect aerial surveys from 2012 through 2016, although surveys were not flown every month or with consistent effort between years (Mallette et al. 2014, 2016). The goal of the current aerial survey project is to complement existing monitoring projects and contribute baseline protected species occurrence data, including species distribution; abundance; density estimates; and seasonal habitat usage. \n",
      "\n",
      "The survey site includes an approximately 6,500-square-kilometer area off the coast of Virginia extending from the southern portion of the eastern shore of Virginia to the North Carolina/Virginia state border. The aerial survey design was established based upon advisements from the Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modeling (CREEM) at the University of St. Andrews and objectives identified by the U.S. Navy. VAQF conducted fixed-wing aerial line-transect surveys, using previously established distance-sampling protocols, to document the occurrence of marine mammals and sea turtles. VAQF worked closely with the UNCW to maintain consistency among the safety, flight, and data-reporting protocols for Hatteras/Onslow/JAX baseline monitoring projects (McAlarney et al. 2013, 2015). The current report describes monitoring activities that occurred between January 2016 and December 2016.\n",

One of the proposed sites within the Cherry Point (CHPT) OPAREA is an area of 1,713 km2 in Onslow Bay, 87 km from the coast of North Carolina. We established a monitoring program designed to estimate density and document distribution and seasonal residency of marine mammals and sea turtles in the proposed USWTR. We established ten 40 nm long transect lines, spaced approximately 5 nm apart. These ten transect lines were surveyed by both shipboard (Duke University Marine Lab) and aerial platforms (conducted by University of North Carolina Wilmington). The survey area incorporates a variety of habitats from shallow waters of the shelf to the continental slope; the Gulf Stream meanders through the eastern portion of the survey area, flowing towards the northeast.

      "The United States (US) Navy proposed constructing an Undersea Warfare Training Range (USWTR) along the US Atlantic coast. In 2008, the US Navy chose the area off of Jacksonville, FL (JAX OPAREA) to be the preferred site of the USWTR. The JAX USWTR site and, like that in Onslow Bay, is 25 nm (46 km) long and 20 nm (37 km) wide (approximately 1700 km2). The survey area straddles the continental shelf and Blake Plateau and includes neritic, shelf waters and pelagic, offshore waters. As part of the Navy's Atlantic Fleet Training and Testing (AFTT) Monitoring Program, shipboard and aerial line transect surveys were implemented in 2009 to estimate density and document distribution and seasonal residency of marine mammals and sea turtles in the proposed USWTR (see <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/datasets/detail/582\">\"DUML vessel-based surveys for proposed JAX USWTR site 2009-2010\"</a> dataset). In January 2012, shipboard line-transect survey methods transitioned to biopsy and photo-identification sampling to address questions of residency and population structure in the area. Vessel survey effort was expended along the 200 m depth contour and occasionally around eddies and fronts generated by the Gulf Stream. We are focusing on residency and population structure with our shipboard surveys because we are:\n",

      "Marine mammals, in particular dolphins are a regular occurrence in the Marlborough Sounds. The species are important both nationally and internationally. There are eight marine mammal species known to frequent the Sounds (Davidson et al., 2011). Two of these are classified as nationally endangered (Hectors and Bottlenose) and one is considered nationally critical (Killer whale or Orca).\n",
      "The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and Discovery Marine Limited (DML) were contracted to map the seabed in the Marlborough Sounds (Queen Charlotte Sound/Tōtaranui and Tory Channel/Kura Te Au) using multibeam sounders. The frequency of the sound emitted by a multibeam echo sounder is outside the hearing range of marine mammals in the Sounds, however as a precaution, NIWA ensured best practice for minimising survey activities in the immediate proximity of marine mammals, including logging all sightings while on multibeam effort.\n",
      "Mulitbeam operators and surveyors logged marine mammal sightings. Blue Planet Marine (BPM) was contracted prior to the survey to provide a review of the potential efforts of a multibeam survey of Queen Charlotte Sound and Tory Channel and make suggestions as to best practice to minimise disturbance. Overall they concluded the survey was in the category of ‘minimal disturbance’ hence not requiring a dedicated MMO onboard (Blue Planet Marine, 2016). This report also gave some recommendations, including survey teams to log sightings, that NIWA adopted in the survey plan.\n",

      "A combination of visual line-transect survey, photo-identification (photo-ID), and automated acoustic monitoring methods is being used to gather important baseline information on the occurrence, distribution, and density of marine mammals near Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) and adjacent areas. The study area was chosen to cover areas where United States (U.S.) Navy activity is substantial, including Chesapeake Bay waters near Naval Station Norfolk, Joint Expeditionary Base (JEB) Little Creek (LC), and JEB Fort Story, as well as a Mine Exercise (MINEX) Area (W-50) in the Atlantic off the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Twenty-five line-transect surveys were completed in two zones (INSHORE and MINEX) between August 2012 and November 2013, with 2,810 kilometers (km) and 8,942 minutes completed on-effort. The majority of sightings were bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), although humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) were also sighted in the study area on occasion. In addition, loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) and leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) were sighted during the study period. Conventional line-transect analysis of bottlenose dolphin sightings showed both spatial and seasonal variation in density and abundance, with greatest abundance in the INSHORE zone during summer months. INSHORE densities were calculated as 3.05 individuals per square kilometer (km2) (N=948) in fall, 0.40 individuals per km2 (N=123) in winter, 1.09 individuals per km2 (N=337) in spring, and 3.52 individuals per km2 (N=1,094) in summer. MINEX densities were calculated as 0.11 individuals per km2 (N=105) in fall, 0.00 individuals per km2 (N=0) in winter, 0.10 individuals per km2 (N=90) in spring, and 0.16 individuals per km2 (N=148) in summer. A photo-ID catalog was created using photos taken during both dedicated photo-ID and line-transect surveys through July 2013; it contains 308 identified individuals to date. Thirty-three individuals were re-sighted; however, most sightings were less than three months and 15 km apart. Additional survey effort will be required before any clear movement patterns can be determined. C-POD acoustic data loggers (www.chelonia.co.uk) were deployed at four sites throughout the study area to cover areas of high U.S. Navy activity. Harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were detected in low numbers near NSN and JEB-LC during winter and spring deployments, and bottlenose dolphins were detected in each deployment location during all deployments from August 2012 to September 2013. Deployments, however, did not provide consistent coverage due to loss of gear. Further study is required to improve accuracy in seasonal density estimates and allow further stratification of those estimates, and to better describe the movement patterns and site fidelity of the bottlenose dolphins in these waters. Visual surveys and additional C-POD deployments are currently planned through August 2014.\n",

      "A three year study was undertaken during 2002 to 2004 from May to September to estimate abundance and density of harbor porpoises on the north coast of Anglesey, Wales, United Kingdom. There were no ecological data regarding the harbor porpoises in Anglesey waters so the ability to influence conservation measures was highly constrained. Boat-based transects using distance sampling techniques were applied so a robust estimate of density and abundance could be attained. The study area consisted of a block approximately 489 km2 extending from the east of Point Lynas to the west of South Stack on north coast of Anglesey. The study area was divided into five blocks consisting of 31 perpendicular transect lines to the shore. Each of the transect lines were surveyed 1–5 times by the end of the three year study. Based on the assumption that g(0) = 1 the density of harbor porpoises for the 489 km2 study site was estimated to be 0.630 individuals/km2 (CV = 0.20) and the abundance is estimated to be 309 individuals (CV = 0.20). Heterogeneity in density and abundance was observed across the five blocks which showed Point Lynas and South Stack to have the highest densities. This distribution was closely associated to fine-scale oceanographic features which cause prey to be concentrated and may facilitate foraging for harbor porpoises. The study showed that Anglesey provides coastal habitats for the harbor porpoise and was the first study of this kind in North Wales, United Kingdom.\n",

      "Purpose:\n",
      "The need for abundance and density estimates was highlighted as a key factor in the conservation and management of the harbor porpoise in Anglesey waters. Moreover, proposed extension of the wind farms from Liverpool Bay to Anglesey and the potential of the area for marine renewable energy devices presented a problem to managers and planners due to the lack of knowledge of harbor porpoise populations in north Wales.\n",

To increase accuracy of observation locations, I went to sea and took waypoints of where I observed the dolphins and whales. I then mapped these points on the nautical map of the region (new 2010 version - WGS 84). The original estimated distances were overestimated by far and the azimuth I was measuring was not that precise. Therefore, when I transformed the distance and azimuth of my observations I took these parameters into consideration and corrected them. The azimuths measured are accurate at 2 degrees. I estimate that the coordinates have a precision of about 0.1 to 0.2 minutes.\n",

      "We set out to determine the spatial and temporal trends for sightings, strandings and captures of hard-shell marine turtles in the northeast Atlantic from two recording schemes. One recording scheme (presented here) included marine turtle sightings, strandings and captures occurring in French waters that originated from annual sightings and strandings publications of Duguy and colleagues (Duguy 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2004; Duguy et al. 1997a, b, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003). Records presented in Duguy publications prior to 2001 contained location descriptions, providing no geographic coordinates with error estimates. Longitude and latitude positions for these events were estimated to be the closest coastal point to the descriptive location.\n",
      "Duguy publications, 2001 onwards, were accompanied by maps displaying the approximate location of sightings and strandings events. These maps were digitized and georeferenced and coordinate positions determined for all appropriate records. Georefenced hard-shell turtle (Lk and Cc) capture/sighting/stranding records from the papers of Duguy for France 1990-2003 (featured in Witt et al. 2007) only includes records that could have coordinates derived from their locational descriptions.\n",
      "The second recording scheme used were records of sightings and strandings of marine turtles in the British Isles obtained from the TURTLE database operated by Marine Environmental Monitoring. Data from the TURTLE database were submitted to EurOBIS and can be viewed on OBIS-SEAMAP: <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/103151990\">Marine Turtles.</a>\n",

      "Features in this feature class represent animal sightings recorded during aerial monitoring surveys for marine mammals and sea turtles performed in January, February, and August 2014 in the Hawaii Range Complex (HRC). Aerial surveys were conducted subsequent to two naval training events in HRC. The surveys involved circumnavigation of the island of Kauai in January–February using a ASTAR 350 B2-7 helicopter, and the islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe in August using a Bell 206L3 helicopter . The associated training events (Koa Kai and Rim of the Pacific or “RIMPAC”) involved the use of mid-frequency active sonar and, in the case of RIMPAC, explosives. The Koa Kai event took place primarily on the Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range and Barking Sands Underwater Range Extension between Kauai and Niihau, Hawaii, during 24–31 January 2014. Following the Koa Kai event, shoreline surveys were conducted on 31 January and 5 February. RIMPAC took place during an extended period from 8 July through 2 August 2014 and involved a broader expanse of ocean off the main Hawaiian Islands. The aerial shoreline surveys performed subsequent to RIMPAC circumnavigated the five islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe over 4 days on 1 and 4–6 August. All surveys involved looking for stranded or near-stranded marine mammals, and observers documented the positions and behavior of all marine mammals and sea turtles seen within 3 km of shore. The survey platform was a small fixed-wing Aero Commander 500. Work was performed under HDR task order KB26 (IDIQ contract award N62470-10-D-3011, NAVFAC LANT).\n",

      "The Indian Ocean has many breeding areas for sea turtles, the southernmost ones being on the Maputaland coast of KwaZulu-Natal, where leatherback turtles nest in large numbers thanks to long-lasting protection programs. For the leatherback this is the only known nesting site in the entire western Indian Ocean. At the end of the reproductive season, leatherbacks undertake migrations towards disparate feeding areas. To contribute to their conservation, the migratory behavior of these animals has been studied by satellite telemetry for several years. This species turned out to frequent widely  dispersed areas ranging from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mozambique Channel, performing large-scale wandering probably due to the leatherbacks' feeding habits on macroplankton such as jellyfish and salps. These movements have been shown to be heavily influenced by the main oceanic currents and oceanographic mesoscale features occurring in the areas crossed.\n",

      "As part of the AMAPPS program, the Southeast Fisheries Science Center conducted aerial surveys of continental shelf and slope waters from New Jersey to North Carolina between 23 November - 31 December, 2016. The survey was flown aboard a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft at an altitude of 600 feet (183 m) and a speed of 110 knots. The survey path followed tracklines oriented perpendicular to the shoreline and latitudinally spaced 20 km apart. “Fine-scale” track lines were surveyed in waters off the coast of New Jersey, Delaware and Virginia. The survey was designed for analysis using Distance sampling and a two-team (independent observer) approach to correct for visibility bias in resulting abundance estimates. Due to staffing issues, one team with four observers (left and right bubbles, belly and a data recorder) conducted the survey between 23-25 November. After 13 December the survey was conducted with two teams per usual protocol.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The Gulf of Maine supports a tremendous diversity of pelagic seabirds, which depend on our highly productive waters to raise their young and complete their annual lifecycle. For species such as Atlantic puffin and razorbills, the Gulf of Maine represents the southern limit of their breeding distribution in the United States. As with any species at the fringe of their distribution, these birds are likely to be highly sensitive to changes in habitat and prey availability resulting from global climate change. Greater shearwaters breed in the southern hemisphere and migrate to the Gulf of Maine during the summer months to forage on the abundant supply of prey species.  Managers are concerned that increasing sea surface temperatures, changes in commercial harvest rates of key forage species, and potential offshore energy development could now threaten the ability of this region to support pelagic seabirds.Maine’s Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy identifies greater shearwater as a priority species for research, and specifically notes the need to conduct shearwater surveys and identify foraging habitat.  We believe this research will promote the conservation of this priority species during offshore energy development and increase our understanding of the potential implications of climate change on pelagic seabirds. Objectives: 1)\tDetermine foraging “hotspots” where pelagic seabirds aggregate in the Gulf of Maine2)\tDetermine migration pathways, habitat use, and residency times for greater shearwaters in the Gulf of Maine3)\tDocument characteristics of marine habitat occupied by pelagic seabirds, and predict how environmental change (i.e. climate change or offshore development) may influence the availability of these habitats  4)\tContribute to ongoing research monitoring the migration of greater shearwaters throughout the Atlantic Ocean, and their return to their breeding grounds in the southern hemisphere. This study will combine direct observations of pelagic seabirds and associated ocean parameters (i.e. sea surface temperatures, depth, and primary productivity) with data generated by the satellite transmitters. This will allow us to determine which habitat characteristics pelagic seabirds are selecting, and the satellite data will provide landscape level use of the Gulf of Maine by pelagic seabirds. This information will play a critical role in the evaluation of offshore energy development for both conservation agencies and potential developers.  While the conservation community is clearly supportive of green energy, we believe it is imperative that wildlife conservation must be considered during the planning and development of these projects. This research will help us guide the energy development into regions of the coast that are less likely to support large concentrations of pelagic seabirds. The shearwaters in this study were named for islands protected by Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge. For more information please contact: Linda_Welch@fws.gov\n",

      "On 1 to 26 June 1993, as part of a larger study, Alaska harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) abundance was investigated during an aerial survey from Prince William Sound to Dixon Entrance. Employing a Twin Otter as the survey platform, the third of three identical sawtooth tracklines was flown at an altitude of 152.2 m (500 ft) and at an airspeed of 185 km/h.  Line-transect methodology was used, and only those observations made during optimal conditions were analyzed. Density of harbor porpoises was calculated using line transect estimates based on perpendicular distances of sightings to the cruise track of the airplane. On average, porpoise group size and density from Prince William Sound to Dixon Entrance was 1.22 (SE = 0.04) and 4.02 groups/100 km2 (SE = 7.42).\n",

      "2) Establish a baseline for detecting changes in abundance through time, for analysis of trends. \n",
      "During the present study, it was not fiscally possible to survey all areas of the state in any one year.

      "Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), a marine protected area located in the US Virgin Islands, is a crucial nesting area for endangered hawksbills, green turtles, leatherback turtles, and loggerheads. Since the recent expansion of the USVI marine protected area at BIRNM, newly included areas have not yet been investigated for sea turtle habitat use. Thus, we are conducting a sea turtle tagging and tracking project to quantify real-time habitat-use of sea turtles within and around BIRNM. We capture reproductive females on nesting beaches and perform a standard workup procedure on each one, including marking each turtle with internal PIT tags and taking standard measurements, blood samples, photographs, and a biopsy punch for isotope (diet) analysis. We are using these data sets to determine whether current BIRNM boundaries encompass habitats most preferred by sea turtles, determine connections between turtles at BIRNM and other protected areas, identify core areas of turtle use, and quantify time spent in and around BIRNM. Our research addresses specific Recovery Objectives outlined in the Federal Recovery Plans for multiple protected species. Our data can be used as the basis for future adaptive management of BIRNM boundaries and also assist in nesting beach surveys conducted by National Park Service (NPS). We received financial support from NPS and USGS, and substantial in-kind support from NPS, without which this project would not have been possible.  In a concurrent study, we deployed an array of 19 acoustic receivers within BIRNM to identify patterns of habitat use for nesting females and turtles captured in the water; an overarching goal of that project is to determine which areas of BIRNM turtles use most often. The NPS and other university colleagues (UMass, UVI) have initiated additional BIRNM acoustic tracking projects, which have substantially augmented and expanded our existing array of receivers to extend past BIRNM borders. We have been maintaining our receivers while collaborating with NPS and other colleagues to get the most out of the expanding array of receivers in the region. By doing so, we can identify core areas of use by all turtles (by species and life stage) and determine the amount of time spent within and outside of the BIRNM.  \n",

Special focus was placed on cetaceans, chelonids, whale sharks and pelagic sea snakes. Within the 233 logged observation hours, 234 first-hand sightings were recorded from a small panga; photo-identification was collected for 76% of those sightings. Dozens of marine species were documented during the survey period, but those that played most prominently in the survey were Humpback whales (<i>Megaptera novaengiae</i>), bottlenose dolphins (<i>Turciops truncatus</i>), pantropical spotted dolphins (<i>Stenella attenuata</i>), green/black sea turtles (<i>Chelonia mydas agassizii</i>), olive ridley sea turtles (<i>Lepidochelys olivacea</i>), hawksbill sea turtles (<i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>), and pelagic sea snakes (<i>Pelamis platurus</i>).

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Marine turtle populations around the globe are threatened through over-harvesting and habitat loss. In the Gulf region, marine turtles have provided food at a subsistence level to fisherman and coastal dwellers since time immemorial. Evidence of this dates back five thousand years! Turtles have also been used traditionally for their fat and meat, and their eggs have fed families dependent on the bounty of the sea. But with increased coastal use and industrialization, and the advent of outboard motors and access to distant markets, the loss of turtles and their eggs has reached a level from which populations are struggling to recover. Turtle eggs, which used to be collected on an occasional, irregular basis, are now collected nearly every single time a nesting female emerges on the beach. Of even greater concern is the increased coastal development - industrialization and urbanization have resulted in severe habitat loss and alteration, and industrialised fisheries, which decimate turtles while at sea, continue to grow. Today, critical measures are urgently needed to safeguard the few remaining turtle nesting sites, their feeding and breeding sites at sea, and their migratory pathways.The project links together numerous stakeholders, from Government agencies to NGOs to the private sector, and will combine scientific research and monitoring with environment awareness centered on marine turtle protection – and bring about regional change –positive change resulting in long-term conservation of marine turtles.This project, using capacity building, awareness raising and satellite tracking and monitoring of marine turtles in the Gulf region as operational building blocks, aims to develop a marine turtle conservation action plan through the results of a three year project with the following objectives:•\tDevelop strategic partnerships amongst government agencies, NGOs and the private sector at both National and Regional levels;•\tRaise the awareness of marine turtle conservation needs at National and Regional levels;•\tElucidate the post-nesting migrations and biology of marine turtles using satellite tracking;•\tIdentify foraging grounds of endangered marine turtles and linkages between nesting and feeding population assemblages;•\tShare tracking data and findings to relevant authorities and contribute to the development of a regional marine turtle conservation plan;•\tIntegrate these conservation initiatives within international conservation agreements on marine turtles and national programmes.\n",

As part of sea turtle research we started satellite tracking on sea turtle to explore their critical offshore biological information needed to apply the conservation measures to save them. All sea turtle are endangered throughout the world including Bangladesh. Most of the offshore scientific information is unknown to us about this rare animal and each year thousands of sea turtles die due to bycatch in Bangladesh marine waters. Sea turtles are highly migratory and share international waters including many countries maritime territory that increases their chance of being caught by various type of fishing nets spread over the vast marine waters. Bangladesh is signatory of the regional and international conventions and treaties to save the endangered sea turtle. To save these global flagship species we need to uncover their migratory routes through which they come to breed and lay eggs in our long sandy beaches each winter, the coastal habitat they use during nesting season and pathways to long distance migrations at post nesting period. To understand this critical information we are going to set Satellite transmitters on olive ridley and green turtle following recognized scientific methods and protocols developed by pioneering sea turtle scientists throughout the world. This satellite tracking on sea turtle is first time in Bangladesh. This will reveal migratory routes of our sea turtle, depth they dive with temperature, nesting intervals and foraging habitat they use. This uncover will tremendously help in national sea turtle conservation efforts. The results will be used by large number of academics and students in the country and Government Department like Department of Forest, Department of Environment, Department of Fisheries, Bangladesh Coast Guard and Navy. We specially encourage your participation and cooperation to accomplish our efforts and fulfill the goal to save sea turtle in our marine waters.\n",

Development of off shore wind energy poses potential threats to marine mammals, including direct effects (i.e. vessel interactions, collision and entanglement with structures, displacement, avoidance, or injury due to noise from construction or operations) and indirect threats (i.e. effects on prey species, increased risk of fishery and vessel interaction through displacement out of the WEA) (BOEM 2012). This information is important to mitigate the potentially harmful impacts from ocean development, shipping, and other anthropogenic activities. To address these existing data gaps, we have collected marine mammal and sea turtle sighting data from aerial surveys conducted off the coast of Virginia from May 2014 to December 2014.\n",

For this reason, extensive sighting surveys to assess their distribution, abundance, and habitat preference are needed. In this study, we conducted systematic surveys to document the distribution of the harbor porpoise observed in the English Channel (North Sea, France). The English Channel is an epicontinental sea. It constitutes a relatively narrow link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea and is influenced by strong tides and freshwater inputs, which create well-mixed waters. The harbor porpoise is placed under Appendix II of the European Union Habitats Directive, and an assessment of his status and distribution in the English Channel, very exposed to human activities, is much needed to identify conservation and management strategies.\n",

      "On 1 to 26 June 1993, as part of a larger study, Alaska harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) abundance was investigated during an aerial survey from Prince William Sound to Dixon Entrance. Employing a Twin Otter as the survey platform, the first of three identical sawtooth tracklines was flown at an altitude of 152.2 m (500 ft) and at an airspeed of 185 km/h. Line-transect methodology was used, and only those observations made during optimal conditions were analyzed. Density of harbor porpoises was calculated using line transect estimates based on perpendicular distances of sightings to the cruise track of the airplane. On average, porpoise group size and density from Prince William Sound to Dixon Entrance was 1.22 (SE = 0.04) and 4.02 groups/100 km2 (SE = 7.42).\n",

Then in 1990, I began studying indigenous populations in the Adriatic Sea. With the group of Electonics directed by Eng. Massimo Azzali (I.R.Pe. M. CNR – Ancona), we worked out many theses about sounds and ultrasound in dolphins’ communication. In particular, we studied the system to prevent dolphins from ending up in fishing nets and the way they have to communicate between different groups. I carried out many research studies in Italy and many European countries, as well as the United States. My interest has been focused in the study of wild and domestic animals, whether by applying conventional veterinary medicine or the homeopathic and natural approach. I decided to create the Organization called Cetaceansound.Org, because I really trust in the opportunity to save dolphins and creatures from the ocean. I’ll keep on working in this field because they represent our future. \n",

      "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN Canada Sable Island Grey Seal Bioprobes project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: Objectives are to better understand the ecological function of large marine carnivores in continental-shelf ecosystems, using grey seals as our model species and novel acoustic technology developed for OTN. There are two components: 1) spatial and temporal patterns of prey encounters by a mobile, large marine predator, and 2) predator movements and foraging distribution in relation to fine- and meso- scale seasonal oceanography in eastern Canada. The first study will contribute to science advice on the impact of pinniped predation on the dynamics of prey populations of commercial or conservation importance. The second study seeks to understand the oceanographic features that grey seals may use to condition the way they search the environment for food and in turn predict how climate variability and long-term change may affect upper-trophic level predators and alter their impact on continental shelf ecosystems.\n",

Our preliminary objective is to produce an estimated inventory of sea turtles using a photo identification monitoring method. This will allow us to better understand turtle population and migration patterns. A major threat these creatures are facing in the country is turtle and egg poaching. For this reason, one aspect of the MSTCP consists of protecting turtle nesting sites and rearing a few individuals per clutch in order to increase their survival rate.Off shore, Olive Ridley Sea Turtles are particularly exposed to Ghost Nets. Another aspect of the MSTCP is to rescue and rehabilitate injured Olive Ridley Sea Turtles and track them after release to study both the success of rehabilitation and the global distribution of the species in the Indian Ocean.\n",

Aerial surveys were conducted subsequent to two naval training events in HRC. The surveys involved circumnavigation of the island of Kauai in January–February using a ASTAR 350 B2-7 helicopter, and the islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe in August using a Bell 206L3 helicopter . The associated training events (Koa Kai and Rim of the Pacific or “RIMPAC”) involved the use of mid-frequency active sonar and, in the case of RIMPAC, explosives. The Koa Kai event took place primarily on the Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range and Barking Sands Underwater Range Extension between Kauai and Niihau, Hawaii, during 24–31 January 2014. Following the Koa Kai event, shoreline surveys were conducted on 31 January and 5 February. RIMPAC took place during an extended period from 8 July through 2 August 2014 and involved a broader expanse of ocean off the main Hawaiian Islands. The aerial shoreline surveys performed subsequent to RIMPAC circumnavigated the five islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe over 4 days on 1 and 4–6 August. All surveys involved looking for stranded or near-stranded marine mammals, and observers documented the positions and behavior of all marine mammals and sea turtles seen within 3 km of shore. The survey platform was a small fixed-wing Aero Commander 500. Work was performed under HDR task order KB26 (IDIQ contract award N62470-10-D-3011, NAVFAC LANT).\n",

      "IntroductionIn its current form the project consists of a collaborative effort between Dubai’s Wildlife Protection Office (WPO) and the Jumeirah Group. It evolved from a small-time operation using fish quarantines, available locally for the occasional turtle stranding, but in 2010 alone, over 350 turtles have passed through the project and have been released into the sea. At the outset of the collaboration, the co-chairman of the Marine Turtle Specialist Group was brought in by WPO to ensure that the project followed best practice guidelines in terms of turtle handling, rehabilitation and release protocols.Sea turtles received consist of three species, The hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata, the green Chelonia mydas and the loggerhead Caretta caretta. Although we have received turtles up to 150Kg, by far the majority of the cases we receive are juvenile hawksbills of around 1kg in weight. An ever-increasing local awareness of our project has led to more turtles being received by the project, primarily in the season from January to April, when local waters can be down to 16C. Many of the turtles passing through our hands are due to the efforts of Emirates Marine Environmental Group, TDIC and Dubai Municipality’s Environment Section, as well as contributions from individuals.Central to the success of the project is the veterinary work provided by our colleagues at the Dubai Falcon Hospital. Original contributions and protocols for turtle receipt and treatment from Peter McKinney in the late 90’s have subsequently seen contributions from numerous successive veterinarians. Mirjam Hampel has recently left us for work in Europe, but in her time with the project she contributed enormously to the development of the project. Some of our combined work may be viewed in Wildlife Middle East articles, available online. We have also been joined by Valentina Caliendo, who brings to us her experiences of working with cold-stunned individuals in the Mediterranean and Adriatic and most recently Conor Kilgallon who is now offering his veterinary expertise.Dubai’s Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (CVRL) provides support in terms of pathology, bacteriology and follow-up blood work.Although much of our work is behind closed doors, Jumeirah Group has donated two large penned areas located at Madinat Jumeirah, which are used by the project as pre-release pens. This provides an important chance to observe behaviour of the turtles immediately prior to release. It also provides a first-class interface between the public and the turtles, contributing greatly to local awareness. In excess of 1000 school children visit the project annually and receive guided tours and information on the turtles.The release pen is furnished with an artificial reef donated by Amusement White Water. This provides environmental enrichment to the animals within, and allows us to observe the turtle’s forage behaviour.The Jumeirah Group has also provided all funding for the eleven satellite tags deployed to date. This provides us with the very exciting opportunity to monitor our turtles post-release. Our 2008 release, Dibba, brought fascinating data back, on its travels from UAE’s East coast to the last known position close to Thailand (8600km). We choose to share all this information via Seaturtle.org in order to contribute to the growing awareness and knowledge of turtle behaviour.The day to day project management is from Wildlife Protection Office’s Kevin Hyland and from Burj al Arab’s Aquarium Management Warren Baverstock and David Robinson.\n",

      "On 1 to 26 June 1993, as part of a larger study, Alaska harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) abundance was investigated during an aerial survey from Prince William Sound to Dixon Entrance. Employing a Twin Otter as the survey platform, the second of three identical sawtooth tracklines was flown at an altitude of 152.2 m (500 ft) and at an airspeed of 185 km/h. Line-transect methodology was used, and only those observations made during optimal conditions were analyzed. Density of harbor porpoises was calculated using line transect estimates based on perpendicular distances of sightings to the cruise track of the airplane. On average, porpoise group size and density from Prince William Sound to Dixon Entrance was 1.22 (SE = 0.04) and 4.02 groups/100 km2 (SE = 7.42).\n",

      "The Northern Puget Sound (NPS) wintering population of lesser snow geese occurs in the Skagit and Fraser Deltas along the western border between the United States and Canada. This population of snow geese have traditionally used very discrete estuary and agricultural habitats associated with Skagit and Port Susan Bays.The breeding grounds of this population are on Wrangel Island, Russia. Because Wrangel Island snow geese represent the last major snow goose population breeding in Asia, and the primary Russian goose population that winters in North America, it is a high priority for the Pacific Flyway and the subject of long standing international cooperative management and conservation. Data collected since the early 1970s on Wrangel Island indicates that the population has grown in abundance, become younger, and changed its behavior relative to traditional habitat and resources. These population changes have become more apparent since the early 1990s and appear to be in response to warmer spring conditions, earlier snowmelt, and changes in the predator community on Wrangel Island. Some of these changes are also evident in the NPS wintering population where the total overwintering population size has increased.The objectives of this project are to examine the current relationship of the NPS population to other Pacific flyway use areas. This will include documentation of migration routes, phenology, staging areas, and stopover locations throughout the flyway. Particular questions that we hope to answer include:      - When do geese depart and return to NPS during spring and fall migration?     - Where are important flyway use areas during migration?     - When and how long do geese use areas along migration routes?     - Document inter and/or intra-year interchange among NPS and other wintering areas.     - Do some geese that use NPS move to other locations within the flyway during the same winter or among different years?     - If NPS geese are moving to other locations, what is the timing of emigration and potential return to NPS?The transmitters are programed to transmit for three years.<strong>Acknowledgments:</strong>WDFW Biologist Roozen and Technicians Anderson, Deyo, and Otto were instrumental in the successful snow goose captures - without their untiring efforts and perseverance through poor weather conditions, deployment of the full sample of transmitters would not have been possible. We are especially grateful to Dr. Scott Ford of <a href=\"http://alaskabirddoc.com/\">Avian Specialty Veterinary Services</a> for his expertise and exceptional work with the transmitter implant procedures, and to WDFW Technician Deyo and Vet-Tech Yana Podobedova who assisted Dr. Ford with many of the procedures. We are also indebted to WDFW Waterfowl Section Manager Kraege for his support for this project; it is because of his efforts that project was able to take flight. We are grateful to the WDFW staff at the Skagit Wildlife Area for their continued support during our capture efforts. We would like to thank M. Axelson for caring for one of the geese that was unable to fly immediately after the capture - this goose quickly recovered and was able to take flight. Vasiliy Baranyuk provided flock sighting information which assisted us in determining where to focus capture efforts.  We are also extremely grateful to the many landowners who were gracious in granting access to their lands.<strong>Project PI's-</strong><a href=\"mailto:Joseph.Evenson@dfw.wa.gov\">Joe Evenson</a> - WDFW Waterfowl Survey and Sea Duck Specialist<a href=\"mailto:Christopher.Danilson@dfw.wa.gov\">Chris Danilson</a> - WDFW District Biologist\n",

We also work hard to promote environmental education and build capacity in local fishing communities with the goal of promoting the long-term sustainability of both the fisheries and the species with which they interact.Our Leatherback Tracking Project is the first telemetry study of the species in Peru. While leatherbacks occur along the entire Peru coast, both near and offshore, our research has identified a high number of interactions with gillnet fisheries in the north of the country. By tracking leatherbacks that have been caught in this fishery, this study will examine leatherback behavior and habitat use to help determine priority areas for conservation and to better understand how these habitats overlap with fishing grounds.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Previous tagging studies of the movements of green turtles (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>) nesting at Ascension Island have shown that they shuttle between this remote target in the Atlantic Ocean and their feeding grounds on the Brazilian coast, a distance of 2300 km or more. Since knowledge of sea turtle migration routes might allow inferences on the still unknown navigational mechanisms of marine animals, we tracked the postnesting migration of six green turtle females from Ascension Island to Brazil. Five of them reached the proximity of the easternmost stretch of the Brazilian coast, covering 1777-2342 km in 33-47 days. Their courses were impressively similar for the first 1000 km, with three turtles tracked over different dates following indistinguishable paths for the first 300 km. Only the sixth turtle made some relatively short trips in different directions around Ascension. The tracks show that turtles (i) are able to maintain straight courses over long distances in the open sea; (ii) may perform exploratory movements in different directions; (iii) appropriately correct their course during the journey according to external information; and (iv) initially keep the same direction as the west-south-westerly flowing current, possibly guided by chemical cues.\n",

      "Purpose:\n",

      "system used by these turtles to pinpoint Ascension, assuming that the same mechanisms guide the postnesting migration as well. Results show that Ascension turtles use information picked up en route to adjust their migratory course, and suggest that current-borne cues, probably of a chemical nature, may be involved in this process for at least part of the journey.\n",

      "Papi et al. (2000) reports the results of an experiment aimed to test the geomagnetic hypothesis by applying a magnetic disturbance to Ascension turtles returning to Brazil.

      "Abstract:\n",
      "A focus of this year's satellite tracking project is to compare stable isotope results with telemetry results to determine the efficacy of using stable isotopes to elucidate post-nesting migratory destinations of sea turtles.  Stable isotope analysis of skin and eggshell tissue (which reflect foraging areas) will be compared with the oceanographic regions visited during satellite tracking.  Stable isotope values that are consistently different for females in oceanic vs. neritic habitats lend credence to their use to infer post-nesting migratory destinations.  A lack of matching between isotope values (pre-nesting habitat) and satellite tracks (post-nesting habitats) would suggest a) that loggerheads do not exhibit philopatry to foraging regions, or b) that loggerhead habitat use is too flexible to use isotopes in inferring habitat use.  A consistent isotope-telemetry match among individuals would suggest that stable isotopes can be used in lieu of the more expensive satellite telemetry approach to potentially infer foraging grounds. A second focus is to track female turtles that are potentially bycatch in the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Fishery bottom longline fishery.

To obtain data on seasonal movements of porpoise, a limited number of transects were made in areas of known porpoise concentrations. When a sighting was made, the following variables were recorded: time, angle, number of reticles to the sighting, radar distance (nm) to the shoreline at the same angle of the sighting, the species, the count of the porpoise seen (best, high, and low), and the animal(s) direction of travel.

      "Between June 2008 and September 2009, 56 days of small boat surveys were conducted off the coast of Sarawak, Malaysia with the aim of recording cetacean distribution. These surveys, which focused on the Miri, Bintulu-Similajau and Kuching regions, comprised 173 hours of survey effort and covered 2851 km of pre-determined systematic tracks. Surveys were clustered into three sets of seasonal snapshots: June-July, September-October and March-April. A total of 115 cetacean sightings were made, of which 65 were on-effort and used in analyses of cetacean encounter rates in relation to habitat characteristics. Species observed included (in order of frequency) Irrawaddy dolphins (<i>Orcaella brevirostris</i>),\n",

      "One hundred and ten of 115 sightings were made in less than 10 m water depth, highlighting the importance of nearshore coastal habitats for these species. Despite an apparent overlap in habitat, Irrawaddy dolphins showed a statistically significant affiliation with areas of shallower depth and closer proximity to shore and river mouths than finless porpoises or bottlenose dolphins. This preference for nearshore areas renders the species vulnerable to threats such as fisheries by-catch and habitat degradation from coastal development. Irrawaddy dolphins were more frequently encountered in Kuching, while the highest encounter rate for finless porpoises was in the Bintulu-Similajau region. The highest encounter rates in both Kuching and Similajau occurred in areas that are destined for major coastal developments. \n",

      "During the 2010 and 2011 nesting seasons in Rethymno, Crete, Greece, 21 satellite tags were deployed on post-reproductive loggerhead turtles, 20 females and 1 male. One tag failed, while the remaining 20 transmitted data during the migration period, with most tags continuing to transmit after the individual had reached a site of residency. The female turtles exhibited three distinct strategies, either migrating north into the Aegean Sea, southwest towards the Libyan or Tunisian coasts or remaining resident within the waters of Crete. Females migrated after completing nesting for the season starting in early July. The male turtle exhibited a different behavior migrating away from the nesting beach in mid-June and traveling into the Western Mediterranean basin.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The oceanic movements of loggerhead turtles (<i>Caretta caretta</i>), green turtles (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>), and a Pacific ridley turtle (<i>Lepidochelys olivacea</i>) were monitored with satellite telemetry between 1996 and 2001 in the Pacific Ocean. During this time, several turtles migrated across the Pacific Ocean, covering more than 11,500 km between Santa Rosalita, Baja California, Mexico (28 degrees 40 minutes N, 114 degrees 14 minutes W), and Sendai Bay, Japan (37 degrees 54 minutes N, 140 degrees 56 minutes E). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that loggerheads feeding in the eastern Pacific eventually return to nest on western Pacific beaches. Baja California loggerhead turtles have been shown, through molecular genetic analysis and flipper tag returns, to be primarily of Japanese origin. \n",
      "We conclude that loggerhead turtles are capable of transpacific migrations and propose that the band of water between 25 and 30 degrees north latitude, the Subtropical Frontal Zone, may be an important transpacific migratory corridor. Recent findings indicate that juvenile loggerheads in the North Pacific move westward against weak (0.1 - 0.3 km/hr) eastward geostrophic currents, demonstrating that passive drift may not entirely explain the dispersal of loggerheads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "The objective of the study was to monitor the oceanic movement, using satellite telemetry, of a Pacific loggerhead turtle initially captured on feeding grounds along the Baja California coast. Movement data also were examined with respect to oceanographic and meteorological information in an effort to gain insight into the navigational cues that guide adult sea turtles and to identify possible transpacific movement corridors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Juvenile loggerhead turtles, <i>Caretta caretta</i>, in the 20 - 85 cm straight carapace length (SCL) size range have been observed in the offshore waters along the Pacific coast of California, USA, and the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. It was suggested that these turtles might be of western Pacific origin, migrating 10,000 km and feeding on pelagic red crabs (<i>Pleuroncodes planipes</i>) along the Baja California coast. Subsequently, Pacific loggerheads appear to utilize the entire North Pacific during the course of development in a manner similar to Atlantic loggerheads' use of the Atlantic Ocean.  After a period of more than 10 years, mature turtles evidently cross the Pacific Ocean from pelagic waters and foraging areas along the Baja California coast to return to natal beaches, a journey of more than 12,000 km in each direction.\n",
      "This is the first effort to document pelagic movements of North Pacific loggerheads from feeding grounds to nesting areas using satellite telemetry. Previous telemetry studies of loggerhead turtles have documented post-reproductive movements, pelagic movements, home ranges, navigational abilities and homing behavior. However, few studies of sea turtles have documented pre-nesting movements from feeding grounds to breeding areas.  Notably, documented movement of a Kemp's ridley turtle (<i>Lepidochelys kempii</i>) from feeding grounds in Louisiana, United States, to its successful nesting in Rancho Nuevo, Mexico.\n",
      "A unique opportunity to track the movements of an adult-sized loggerhead turtle, rarely encountered along the Baja California coast, emerged in 1996. The turtle had been raised in captivity and used in the initial genetic analysis of Baja California loggerhead turtles. Its mature size, genetic affinities with Japanese turtles, and the existence of a previous tag return from Japanese waters of a captive-raised, Baja California loggerhead turtle were the deciding factors in choosing this particular turtle for the study. This turtle is included in the dataset as series 7667, named Adelita. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adelita was monitored following release at Santa Rosalita, Baja California, Mexico (28 degrees 40 minutes N, 114 degrees 14 minutes W). The turtle was first captured in October 1986 by sport fishermen in Bahia de Los Angeles, Baja California, and maintained in captivity at the Centro Regional de Investigaciones Pesqueras, Sea Turtle Research Station (CRIP-STRS). At the time of capture, it had a straight carapace length (SCL) of 29.9 cm and weighed 4 kg. The turtle was used in a study of captive growth rates and in genetic analysis of Pacific loggerhead stocks. Genetic studies suggested that this individual was of Japanese origin. At the time of release, the turtle measured 83.4 cm (SCL) and weighed 95 kg. The tail measured 3.5 cm from the edge of the carapace to the tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixteen other satellite tagged turtles are included in this dataset. Each turtle is identified by series number, name, species, and life stage. The shortest track consists of 20 locations, and the longest track includes 787 locations. Most of the tracked turtles were adult females, one turtle was an adult male, and the remainder were juveniles. \n",
      "\n",
      "A model ST-3 backpack transmitter manufactured by Telonics, Inc. (Mesa, Arizona, United States) was programmed with a duty cycle of 6 hours on, 6 hours off. The transmitter was attached to the second vertebral scute (counting from the anterior) of the turtle's carapace using a modified version of the attachment technique. Specifically, we substituted a thin layer (&lt;1 cm) of tinted two-part marine epoxy (Marine-Tex; Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania, United States) for Silicone Elastomer. Epoxy was also used to create a small faring on the leading and trailing edges of the transmitter to reduce drag. Release of the telemetered turtle occurred about 2 km offshore of Santa Rosalita, Baja California, Mexico (28 degrees 40 minutes N, 114 degrees 14 mintes W), on 10 August 1996, 10 years after initial capture. Transmission data were received via the Argos/NOAA satellite-based location and data collection system, which interprets and classifies signal locations in categories called location classes (LC). In addition to the date and location, data included surface time for each 12-hour period, average dive time for each 12-hour period, last dive time and temperature. Only positions with LCs of 0, 1, 2 or 3 were included in the analysis of distances traveled and swim speeds. LCs of 1 or greater have known error factors of &lt;1,000 m and accuracy increases with location class (LC = 2, accuracy within 350 m; LC = 3, within 150 m). Distances and headings were calculated using variations of the Great Circle Equation. Each segment of the track, or distance traveled between quality locations, is presented and swim speeds for these segments are calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time between locations. The straightness index, or the ratio between the great circle distance (shortest line between the release location and the final location) and the calculated distance traveled, was calculated using endpoints of the track.\n",

      "Gnaraloo Loggerhead Turtle Satellite TaggingGnaraloo Station is a working pastoral station and wilderness tourism business located in a remote part of mainland Western Australia approximately 1,100 km north of Perth. The station abuts 65 km of pristine coastline at the southern end of the Ningaloo Reef and Ningaloo Marine Park.The beaches at Gnaraloo Station provide nesting habitat for predominantly loggerhead (Caretta caretta), some green (Chelonia mydas) and possibly hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles generally from November to March each year.  The Gnaraloo Turtle Conservation Program (GTCP) (www.gnaraloo.com/conservation www.gnaraloo.org   Facebook) has conducted scientific monitoring of turtle activity at rookeries on the Gnaraloo coastline since 2008.The nesting range of loggerhead turtles in Western Australia extends from Dirk Hartog Island in the south to the Muiron Islands in the north, with important rookeries in-between including Gnaraloo Bay, Gnaraloo Cape Farquhar, Janes Bay and Bungelup in the Ningaloo Marine Park.  With loggerhead turtles also being satellite tagged at Dirk Hartog Island and South Muiron Island during the season 2015/16 (1 July 2015 – 30 June 2016), the satellite tagging at Gnaraloo by the GTCP forms part of a broader co-ordinated program to understand inter-nesting movements, post-nesting migrations, and identify foraging grounds and potential threats across the turtles' entire nesting range in Western Australia.   \n",

      "This project seeks to find out more about the migratory movements and foraging behavior of loggerhead sea turtles from North Carolina. Four nesting females have been tracked each year from 2003 through 2008 and made impressive movements as far north as New Jersey, and south as far as the Bahamas and Florida Keys. To date the transmitters have provided novel data about the migratory and foraging behavior and natural history of the loggerhead sea turtle in this region (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00354.x\">Hawkes et al 2007</a>). Recent studies suggest that rising temperatures in Florida may threaten successful production of loggerhead hatchlings and that the northern subpopulation of loggerhead sea turtles in the southeastern US (Georgia to North Carolina) may represent a buffer against potential climate change (<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/Hawkes_2007_GlobalChanBiol.pdf\">Hawkes et al 2007</a>). This project complements results from previous years and provide insights in to the long-term movement patterns of this critical segment of the largest loggerhead nesting population in the world. Through the deployment of a small number of satellite transmitters over a large timespan we hope to monitor and document potential changes in individual and population level movement patterns.\n",

      "On 6 July to 9 August 1992, as part of a larger study, Alaska harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) abundance was investigated during an aerial survey off Kodiak Island. Employing a Twin Otter as the survey platform, the third of three identical sawtooth tracklines was flown at an altitude of 152.2 m (500 ft) and at an airspeed of 185 km/h. Line-transect methodology was used, and only those observations made during optimal conditions were analyzed. Density of harbor porpoises was calculated using line transect estimates based on perpendicular distances of sightings to the cruise track of the airplane. On average, porpoise group size and density off Kodiak Island was 1.41 (SE = 0.13) and 1.85 groups/100 km2 (SE = 6.03).\n",

The first nine (9) months, in July 2007 in waters surrounding the Rosario Islands, Cartagena - Colombia, the second in 2008 in the area of Pearl Lagoon in Nicaragua intercepted one (1) year after its release, and the third, found in the Mexico Gulf, 70 Km  from Pensacola, Southeast Florida, United States,five (5) months since introduction.The Program is aware of the situation of these ancient animals and the lack of information about their activity in the area, we decided to use Satellite tracking devices supported by the University under the Creative Project Implementation of Satellite Tracking in Sea Turtle because despite the importance of previous reports that suggest two possible migration routes: the first residential (with the use of local currents), and the second International (northwest along the Caribbean Sea), it is evident that existing information is insufficient to confirm the use of it and require decades of continuous labeling for its determination.For those reasons ProCTMM introduced on 5 December at Bay Gayraca (PNNT), the first Hawksbill Turtle in the Colombian Caribbean with this technology attached to its shell in order to achieve tangible results, which will help to elucidate possible migration routes of these individuals in the area, and identify the possible coupling of juveniles belonging to the Head-start project.\n",

Our research is based on the use of systematic boat-based surveys for describing the distribution and habitat use of different marine mammal species. We employ photo-identification techniques for the recognition of individual whales and dolphins, and we have developed new statistical approaches for using these data to determine abundance estimates and occupancy patterns. This photographic sampling is complemented by the collection of skin and faecal samples for molecular genetic analysis, which are being used to assess levels of genetic diversity and investigate the structuring of marine mammal populations.\n",

Two indices, cumulative wind stress (Intensity) quantifying physical forcing, and surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) quantifying the ocean’s biological response, revealed variability in upwelling at a variety of temporal scales. Within seasons, upwelling Intensity peaked during February, and chl-a during February–March. Blue whale encounter rate from 52 aerial surveys was modelled against upwelling indices and the climate signal SAM (Southern Annular Mode), at individual survey- and aggregated season-levels, using General Additive Models (GAMs). Survey-level GAMs showed that encounter rate increased with increasing chl-a, and with increasing upwelling Intensity to a point beyond which further increases in Intensity resulted in declining encounter rates. This indicated the importance of productivity, as well as relaxation of upwelling, in producing optimal blue whale foraging conditions. In exploratory season-level models, a strong influence of SAM was apparent, with higher encounter rates associated with positive SAM during the preceding 12 months. Including chl-a improved the model, indicating that both broad-scale climatic signals inherently incorporating environmental variability and uncertainty, as well as more proximal regional factors may influence blue whale occurrence in the study area. Measuring the complex relationships between whale occurrence and upwelling is complicated by the fact that the population of blue whales using the Bonney Upwelling is open, and moves between alternate foraging areas. The findings were interpreted in the context of blue whale foraging ecology in this system.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Reports from National Marine Fisheries Service (2009) recently identified a high level of estimated takes of sea turtles in the bottom longline portion of the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fishery, based on onboard observer data.  Mounting pressure has come from environmental groups to act immediately to protect imperiled sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico. The fisheries observer data revealed that the Gulf of Mexico bottom longline fishery, which targets reef fish like grouper and tilefish, resulted in the capture of nearly 1,000 threatened and endangered sea turtles between July 2006 and the end of 2007. Coalitions of environmental groups have asked that the commercial bottom longline fishery be suspended until the National Marine Fisheries Service meets its legal obligations under the Endangered Species Act to ensure that the fishery does not imperil sea turtles and other threatened species in the Gulf of Mexico. \tOf particular concern for the groups are loggerhead sea turtles, which accounted for 799 of the 974 captured turtles in the government analysis. This is more than three times the number of loggerheads the Service authorized the fishery to take in 2005 and may well jeopardize the species. Loggerhead nesting populations in Florida have dropped by over 40 percent over the past 10 years. The large number of juvenile and reproductive adult turtles injured or killed by the bottom longline fishery is likely contributing to this steep decline.  \tThe Gulf of Mexico bottom longline fishery operates primarily off the west coast of Florida, an area that also provides key habitat for several sea turtle species, including loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and green turtles. Bottom longline gear generally consists of a four- to 10-mile-long mainline made of steel cable or monofilament with up to 2,100 hooks. Sea turtles are caught on the lines when they attempt to eat the bait from hooks or become entangled when swimming near a line. Unable to surface for breath, they suffer injury or death.\tEven though the bottom longline fishery has far exceeded the number of turtles it is allowed to take under the Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service has not closed the fishery while it studies options for reducing turtle take.  The fishery is also known to catch endangered smalltooth sawfish and could affect staghorn and elkhorn coral, which are also protected under the Endangered Species Act.Clearly there is a pressing and urgent need for studies that employ cutting edge technologies to evaluate the temporal and spatial components of overlap between fishery effort and sea turtle home ranges and foraging areas.This is a high priority for Sarasota nesting beaches are home to 40 percent of loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nests in the Gulf of Mexico.  This species is protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Marine Turtle Protection Act Chapter 370.12 (Florida Administration Code), and local regulations.  Internationally, it is considered “vulnerable” and is listed as a species threatened with extinction in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.Conservation efforts are hampered by lack of knowledge of the distant foraging grounds where turtles spend 99 percent of their lives. This project will use satellite technology to identify the foraging areas of adult female loggerheads as they leave the breeding beaches and enter the zones of longline bycatch in the Gulf of Mexico.Amendment 31 background: NOAA Fisheries Service implemented a rule, effective October 16, 2009, to reduce the sea turtle bycatch in the bottom longline component of the Gulf of Mexico reef fish fishery. The rule prohibits bottom longlining for Gulf reef fish east of 85o30’W longitude (near Cape San Blas, Florida) shoreward of the line approximating the 35-fathom depth contour (see map and table) with a restriction of 1,000 hooks per vessel with no more than 750 hooks being fished or rigged for fishing at any given time. For the purpose of this paragraph, “hooks rigged for fishing” means hooks attached to a line or other device capable of attaching to the mainline of the longline. During vessel transit through closed zones, no reef fish may be possessed unless bottom longline gear is appropriately stowed, meaning that a longline may be left on the drum if all gangions and hooks are disconnected and stowed below deck; hooks cannot be baited, and all buoys must be disconnected from the gear, but may remain on deck. As a reminder, in the case of the 35-fathom regulation line intersecting a marine reserve, fishermen must also adhere to the regulations for the reserve. The purpose of this rule is to balance the continued operation of the bottom longline component of the reef fish fishery while maintaining adequately protective measures for loggerhead sea turtles pending implementation of long-term mitigation measures. However, there are fundamental facets of loggerhead spatial ecology that were not addressed (including spatial, temporal, and depth overlap) in Amendment 31 that suggest the NMFS mitigation measures (collectively identified as Amendment 31) are not completely addressing early biological recommendations suggested by previous MML or FWC tracking studies (see Fig. 3, 4, 5).  Specifically, the biological data already gleaned, when augmented by the proposed research project should robustly demonstrate that the measures of Amendment 31 continue to leave reproductive females at risk (Tucker 2008). The goal of this proposal is to answer some of the key management questions remaining about the extent of overlap between endangered sea turtle on the west Florida shelf and the Gulf of Mexico grouper longline fishery. Potential for sea turtle take by Gulf of Mexico grouper longliners needs review.  The current take by grouper longlines appears to be low or negligible, but data are really deficient to draw firm conclusions for the purposes of management.  Anecdotes suggest that on occasions, potential high levels of take can occur and in such cases, the specifics need to be better identified.Projected outcomes: rigorous estimates of spatial and temporal habitat use by sea turtles that will produce management information that is critical to the conservation of sea turtles and which can be incorporated to refine Amendment 31.\n",

      "See Project ID 1151 for tracking of courting greens from Sandy Cape: http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/?project_id=1151The traditional owners of K'gari (Fraser Island), the Butchulla people, gained Native Title over much of K'gari in 2014, and we acknowledge their long heritage on and nurturing of this beautiful land, and wish them well with their new opportunities.The idea of monitoring nesting turtles in the Sandy Cape rookery on K'gari-Fraser Island was initiated in the 1992-3 season by Rowan Foley, a Butchulla, who was then employed as a Ranger by Queensland (National) Parks and Wildlife Service, (QNPWS, now QPWS) and as a result some nest and track-count monitoring was  undertaken by long-time annual campers Karl &amp; Sue Klein, and the Lighthouse Keepers, Dudley &amp; Sue Fulton, &amp; Aubrey Strydom &amp; Lainie Rowe. In the 1993-4 season Steve Price - QNPWS 2IC Ranger at Waddy Point, with the support of his RIC Bart Klekar, came to the top end of K'gari-Fraser Island with the two Michaels - volunteers from the Mon Repos Turtle Rookery.A number of Park Rangers and the Lighthouse Keepers were inducted into turtle I.D., tagging, and data sheet entry and so began an 18 year monitoring program, with a 17 night mid-season nesting census and flipper tagging of all turtles coming ashore during the census across the 44km of beach from Rooney Point to Ngkala Rocks.  In that first season the first nest relocation to near the Lighthouse gate by vehicle was trialed, using three doomed clutches laid below the king tide level.This was successful and since then 5 nest relocation cages with a total capacity of 120 clutches have been developed at strategic locations along the rookery, and recently also at Orchid Beach, to enable protection of doomed loggerhead and green clutches, and to provide protection for a percentage of loggerhead clutches from vehicle and camping impacts, and dingo and goanna (monitor lizard) depredation.In the first few years in the 1990's between 50 to 100 greens, but only 5 to 7 loggerheads were nesting annually, and drowned adult loggerhead turtles were being found washed up on the beach. Nesting numbers increased to twelve to fifteen loggerheads a year from 1997 when a seasonal 3 to 5 km wide trawl exclusion zone was established along the NW beach between Rooney Point and Sandy Cape, and then climbed to near 50 nesting each year after the introduction of TEDs, (Turtle Exclusion Devices) in the Queensland trawl fishery nets in 2001.Currently annually about 40 to 50 loggerheads nest along the 44 kilometers of the Rooney Point to Sandy Cape to Ngkala Rocks rookery, and between 50 and 100 loggerhead nests are protected by relocation each season, by the Sandy Cape Lighthouse Volunteer Caretakers, in a program supported by QPWS.Green nests are not generally relocated as the Southern Barrier Reef green turtle population is still slowly increasing since turtle protection in Queensland began in the early 1950s.While most commonly between 50 and 100 green turtles come in to nest each year, a factor that provides some protection to the greens is their pattern of sometimes alternatively flooding the predators one season with a mass nesting and starving them the next.  The largest cyclic influx of nesting green turtles saw them varying from over 600 nesting in the Sandy Cape rookery one season, to three nesting the nest season.A study of dingo impacts on the nests saw nest depredation vary between 15% in a season when there was a mass nesting of over 250 greens and 85% when there were only about 30 greens nesting. A potential new threat to the rookery is the advance of feral foxes up K'gari-Fraser Island.  They are in large numbers on the adjacent mainland and are good swimmers.Recently foxes have been sighted at Awinya Creek, only 30 to 40 kilometers from either end of the Sandy Cape rookery, and monitoring of nests for any fox impacts will guide management plans to provide further protection.Over the years since 1993 over 500 male green turtles were tagged courting in the shallows or basking on the beach, and a correlation between their numbers and the size of the concurrent green nesting season was observed.  Some were found to be carrying flipper tags from the Shoalwater Bay turtle rodeo program, and K'gari-Fraser Island tagged males were being found at Shoalwater Bay, and in the Whitsundays. It was found that female green turtles tagged on the Island in the September/October courting season were being seen that season nesting further north at other rookeries in the Southern Great Barrier Reef, and at the Wreck Rock mainland rookery. In 2014 two males were tagged while courting at Sandy Cape and one returned home to Shoalwater Bay and one to the outer Barrier Reef near Olympic Reef.The green female April O'Moreton, who had been tagged as a juvenile in 1992 in Moreton Bay was found courting at Sandy Cape in 2015 and given a satellite tracker, and she moved on to nest at North West Island in the Capricorn Bunker group. In the 2015-16 season the project also tracked 5 green males and in 2016-17 a further 6 green males, to expand the knowledge of where they come from to court at Fraser Island, what connectivity they have to other known courting areas, and to examine the areas in the Great Sandy Marine Park they use during their courting sojourn.Three females were tracked in the 2016-17 season - one with a history of nesting at K'gari-Fraser Island, one known to forage in the Whitsundays, and one known to nest at Wreck Island in 1998 in the Capricorn Bunker group.In November 2017, 3 nesting loggerhead females and 8 nesting green females were given trackers, to enable comparison of the female's inter-nesting habitat use with that of the males courting habitat, and help inform an assessment of the adequacy of the seasonal go-slow and no-trawl zones in the Great Sandy Marine Park.   \n",

      "The Sea Turtle Rescue Center (DEKAMER) were established in 2009 in Dalyan, Mugla-Turkey after a protocol was agreed upon between the Directorate of the Conservation of Nature and National Natural Parks and the Environmental Protection Agency for Special Areas of Turkish Ministry of Environment of Forestry, the Municipality of the Dalyan, and Pamukkale University. Later that year, the Higher Educational Council of Turkey officially recognized the rescue center and its constitution was published in the Turkish Official Newspaper. Despite there being a number of nesting and foraging grounds along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, only one turtle rescue centre has been established following the RAC/SPA (Regional Activity Center/Special Protected Areas) guidelines (RAC/SPA, 2004). The center is set up for year-round activity to help educate the public about conservation efforts for sea turtles. DEKAMER will act as the regular body, monitoring Dalyan beach for nesting activities, by accepting volunteers from all Universities worldwide.  Any injured turtles found along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey are also brought the center, where care of their necessary medical treatment and rehabilitation is given. DEKAMER is open for both national and international collaborations in all types of scientific studies.The sea turtles from Turkey will be monitored in the Mediterranean Sea. These turtles have either been chosen as post rehabilitation candidates and/or post nesting activity candidates.The main aim of this study is to protect the natural habitats of the sea turtles, by learning their wintering, migration and foraging grounds. With this work we aim to learn the migration routes of sea turtles in the Mediterranean, and we will also concentrate on conserving their marine habitats, not only their nesting beaches.The rehabilitation centers are doing a very good job in educating the public about the need and conservation of sea turtles and to raise the awareness of the public and visitors to the center of the plyt of the worlds sea turtles. One of the best tests of the success and adaptation of life back to the wild after rehabilitation of the released animal sack wild is to follow them in the sea. This can only be achieved with satellite telemetry.Satellite tracking facilitates rapid identification of critical habitats, thus representing a valuable tool for elucidating management requirements. In the case of small threatened rookeries the methodology is particularly useful, as with moderate capital investment detailed information can be gathered very quickly. By tracking rehabilitated and nesting green and loggerhead turtles, we set out to rapidly delineate habitats (nesting beaches, inter-nesting areas, migratory routes, and foraging grounds) utilized by turtles originating from Turkey. In this way, we aimed to highlight prioritize areas for conservation. There have only been a few monitored turtles from nesting beaches, this work will be the first one aimed at the monitoring of turtles post-rehabilitation and post-nesting.\n",

      "Stable isotope analyses and satellite telemetry were used to investigate the relationship between the body size and feeding habitat of adult female loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta around Japan. A total of 149 females from 2 nesting sites, 600 km apart, 1 in Minabe and 1 in Yakushima, was examined by stable isotope analyses of the egg-yolk in 1998 and 1999. Since there were neither significant intra- nor inter-clutch variations in δ13C or δ15N egg-yolks from the same female, the isotope signatures of a single egg-yolk from any clutch in a nesting season could be used to represent those of its nesting female. Both isotopic values increased as the body size of the nesting female increased, irrespective of nesting site. Comparisons between isotopic values of loggerhead egg-yolks and prey items revealed size-related differences among both feeding habits (planktonic or benthic) and habitat areas (pelagic or neritic) of female loggerheads. In 1999, 5 females nesting in Minabe were tracked by satellite. After the nesting season, 2 females with low isotopic values migrated to the pelagic Pacific along the Kuroshio Current, whereas 3 with high isotopic values migrated to the neritic East China Sea. The former females were smaller than the latter. These results were consistent with inferences from stable isotope analyses and previous findings, indicating that the body size, habitat area, and feeding habit of female loggerheads around Japan are closely related. In addition, there were no significant differences in δ13C or δ15N between recruits and remigrants, implying that female loggerheads do not change their feeding habitats during the reproductive stage. We postulate that female habitat selection as a function of body size is closely related to the recruitment and settlement in immature loggerheads, which return to Japan after developmental migrations in the North Pacific.\n",

      "South Muiron Island Loggerhead Turtle TaggingThe Muiron Islands are located off the North West Cape of Western Australia, approximately 1200 km north of Perth.  The Island group consists of South and North Muiron islands, which are separated by a deep-water channel, and Sunday Island which is smaller and lies further east.  The islands are protected for their diverse marine environment and important seabird and turtle nesting areas through the Muiron Islands Marine Management Area, Western Australia’s first marine management area, which was gazetted on 30 November 2004.Close by lies the Ningaloo Reef, Australia’s largest fringing coral reef, boasting spectacular coral formations, abundant fishes and species with special conservation significance such as turtles, whale sharks, dugongs, whales and dolphins.  Ningaloo Marine Park was first gazetted in 1987 to recognise and protect this diverse biological hotspot with amendments made to park boundaries on 30 November 2004 to encompass the whole of the Ningaloo Reef.  The Department of Parks and Wildlife is the primary manager of these reserves.  The Muiron islands and the beaches of the Ningaloo coast provide an important habitat and relatively undisturbed nesting area for the loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles between November and March each year.  Flatback and leatherback turtles have also been recorded foraging occasionally along the Ningaloo coast.  In recognition of these important and diverse reserves, the surrounding area was bestowed the highest level of international recognition with its inscription on the World Heritage List for its natural beauty and biological diversity in June 2011. The Ningaloo World Heritage Area encompasses  604,500ha in total, including the Muiron Islands Marine Management Area, Ningaloo Marine Park, Cape Range National Park, the Learmonth Air Weapons Range and Bundegi and Jurabi Coastal Parks. The nesting range of loggerhead turtles in Western Australia extends from Dirk Hartog Island in the south to the Muiron Islands in the north, with important rookeries in between, including Gnaraloo Bay, Cape Farquhar, Janes Bay and Bungelup in the Ningaloo Marine Park. Satellite tagging at the Muiron Islands is part of a broader coordinated program in the 2015/16 season to understand inter-nesting movements, post-nesting migration, identify foraging grounds and potential threats across their entire nesting range in Western Australia with loggerhead turtles also tagged at Dirk Hartog Island and Gnaraloo.\n",

      "The Cape Verde archipelago, 500km off the West Coast of Africa, hosts one of the worlds largest nesting colonies of the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta).  Although marine turtles have been recorded at Cape Verde as early as 1479 (when the French explorer Eustache de la Fosse reported that sea turtles could be used by humans for medicinal and nutritional purposes), it was not until 1998 that Project Natura 2000 began comprehensive studies to assess the status, distribution and abundance of marine turtles in the Cape Verde archipelago.  To date, 3,377 loggerhead turtles have been tagged on the beaches of Boavista, just one of the 15 islands and islets of the Republic of Cape Verde.  Boavista is known to host the largest number of nesting turtles in the archipelago although the number of turtles is thought to have been declining since the start of surveys due to threats by human predation.The nesting population of Cape Verde has been identified as a priority for conservation along the West Coast of Africa and more information needs to be collected on its natural history, including migratory pathways and foraging areas.  This study will investigate these post nesting migratory pathways and foraging grounds and describe diving and depth utilisation patterns.Subscribe <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?form=1&amp;project_id=26\">here</a> for email updates.\n",

The data are a spreadsheet of points representing seal locations. The low and irregular uplink rate from an SRDL on a seal to the Argos satellites can result in potentially significant errors in some location fixes. Therefore, locations were filtered using an algorithm based on a [maximum speed parameter] of 2 m s-1. This filter rejected 17% of the primary locations that would have required an unrealistic rate of travel to achieve. However, this does not remove all invalid locations hence there are still some data points occurring inland. There are 9,454 locations in the spreadsheet covering all months of the year except February and March.\n",

      "Grey seals <i>Halichoerus grypus</i> Fab. are large, numerous marine top predators. The British population in 1994 was estimated to be 108,000 individuals and it has been steadily increasing since. Fears concerning competition with fisheries have prompted calls for control measures under the UK Conservation of Seals Act 1970. However, little is known about the areas where grey seals forage or of the distances they may travel. Management must be based on an understanding of the complex seal-fishery interactions, a component of which is having information on the temporal and spatial distribution of seals.\n",

      "El seguimiento vía satélite de las tortugas marinas capturadas dentro del territorio Mexicano, mediante la aplicación de transmisores, provee conocimientos sobre la conducta de los individuos durante las ínteranidaciones, lugares de estancia, distancias y posibles rutas en el desplazamiento post temporada de anidación. Lo anterior contribuye al estudio de su comportamiento en el mar, lo cual provee conocimientos invaluables para definir las diferentes rutas migratorias y estimar él o los grupos componentes de la población reproductiva. El uso de telemetría nos ofrece un gran apoyo, para responder a preguntas esenciales para el manejo y la conservación de las tortugas marinas, así como comparar nuestros resultados con otras poblaciones de tortugas en el mundo. \t \tConsiderando la importancia de este tipo de estudios el Gobierno Municipal de Los Cabos, B.C.S. a través de su Programa para Protección de Tortugas Marinas, con el apoyo de la Alianza WWF-Telcel y CONANP, en el año del 2009 dieron inicio al al proyecto “TRAS LA RUTA DE LAS TORTUGAS GOLFINAS .... !!!”, debido a la poca información con la que se cuenta para esta especie con respecto a sus movimientos y rutas migracionales en Los Cabos, los datos que se obtienen del seguimiento de las tortugas que son estudiadas, podrán servir de base para futuras decisiones en cuanto a conservación y manejo.  \t \tDurante el año 2016, el H. XII Ayuntamiento de Los Cabos y La Organización para la Sustentabilidad y Conservación del Medio Ambiente, AC con el apoyo del Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Resort del Pedregal y el Hotel Hilton Los Cabos dan continuidad al proyecto de seguimiento vía satélite liberando en las Playas de Los Cabos, BCS a tres tortugas hembras adultas (llamadas Rayito, Xareni y Bella) a las que les fue instalado un transmisor satelitas. \t \tAunado al seguimiento El Programa de Protección a la Tortuga Marina del H. XII Ayuntamiento de Los Cabos, BCS con la ayuda de El Grupo Tortuguero de Las Californias, AC dan continuidad a un proyecto educativo en el cual a través del seguimiento satelital de esta tortuga se realizaran actividades que están diseñadas principalmente para los niveles de primaria y bachillerato, y que pueden ser adaptadas para niveles superiores o inferiores. Todas y cada una de las actividades han sido correlacionadas con los programas de estudio de la Secretaría de Educación Pública. Además, muchas son interdisciplinarias e incluyen español, matemáticas, historia, ciencias sociales, así como conocimientos y habilidades científicas. \t \tLas actividades están diseñada para realizarse independientemente, durante el seguimiento de (Rayito, Xareni y Bella) a través de internet o simplemente como una experiencia posterior. Cada actividad presenta al inicio una o varias preguntas que promueven la participación de sus alumnos en una lluvia de ideas, para despertar interés en el tema, para fomentar el hábito de la investigación, para permitir que sus alumnos compartan con los demás lo que ya saben, para que hagan más preguntas y juntos busquen las respuestas y disfruten del proceso Enseñanza - Aprendizaje, recordando siempre que el proceso de llegar a una conclusión es tan importante como la conclusión misma. Con esto (Rayito, Xareni y Bella) se convierten en invaluables tortugas marinas no solo para conocer su biología, sino para ayudarnos a enseñar dentro de las aulas.

Con este proyecto se pretende conocer por primera vez, los movimientos de esta especie dentro del Golfo de California, lo que aportara información importante para las estrategias de conservación de la especie.ENGLISH:Nine years after its creation, the Wildlife Protection and Conservation Program at the CIIDIR Sinaloa campus of Instituto Politécnico Nacional (National Polytechnic Institute), has developed a series of research projects focusing mainly on sea turtle conservation in northwest Mexico. This has been made possible through institutional support and the collaboration of national and international institutions and Non-Governmental Organizations. The Loggerhead turtles of the Gulf of California satellite telemetry project has been made possible through the support and collaboration between the Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Red Tortuguera A.C., Grupo Tortuguero de las Californias A.C., Smithsonian Mason School of Conservation, Instituto de Ciencias del Mar y Limnología/UNAM and the local fishing communities of La Reforma and Angostura, who voluntarily reported bycatch of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). These reports became the first formal records of this species in the southern Gulf of California. This project aims to determine for the first time the movements of loggerheads in the Gulf of California, which will supply us with important information for the implementation of conservation strategies for the species.\n",

      "The history of sea turtle research is shaped by researchers having convenient access to turtles while nesting on land.  However, marine turtles face threats for the other 99% of their life cycle in seas far from the nesting beach.  The major rookery of loggerhead nesting in the Gulf of Mexico is in Sarasota County where the beaches are monitored by the Mote Marine Laboratory's Sea Turtle Conservation and Research Program and Coastal Wildlife Club, Inc.  While there is a firm grasp of the terrestrial challenges in maintaining viable nesting beaches, there is less certainty of threats in the oceanic realm once females depart the nesting beaches.  A key to understanding the in-water life history is to follow the turtle movements.Tracking the movements of marine turtles is a challenge because they migrate between spatially distant developmental, breeding, and adult feeding habitats. Consequently, the management of highly migratory turtles requires a regional management approach. Turtles that nest in Florida may migrate from the Gulf of Mexico, Eastern Atlantic, or Caribbean.  The converse is also true, that turtles feeding in Florida waters may later migrate elsewhere to nest. This migratory behavior poses several key management questions.  Where do turtles travel from the nesting beach? What hazards do they encounter en-route to and from a feeding ground? Can portions of their travel routes be safeguarded during a migration?  Do all turtles take the same route or do individuals select different routes and habitats? Another set of questions arises about their responses to oceanic variables such as currents and temperature. Do sea turtles migrate seasonally in response to winter temperatures?  Are the home habitats spatially diffuse or do they congregate at current boundaries or eddies?  Tracking migratory paths can detail critical habitat use through the year as travel corridors and destinations are mapped in relation to potential threats, such as incidental capture in coastal or pelagic fisheries, harmful algal blooms, or zones of boat traffic.  \n",

While it has been supposed that loggerheads frequent this area only during the warmest months and then undertake seasonal migrations towards southern (warmer) waters, the occurrence of such migrations have never been demonstrated. On the other hand, the fact that loggerheads are found in Tuscany waters throughout the year (winter months included) can indicate that the picture is more complex and variable than previously supposed.  The aim is to localize the areas frequented by loggerheads in the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea, to document the occurrence of seasonal migrations and/or to investigate the turtles' fidelity to specific feeding areas.\n",

      "Loggerhead nesting on Masirah Island, Oman, was first studied in depth in the late 1970s. It was estimated that around 30,000 female turtles came to nest each year on its beaches making it one of the largest, if not the largest loggerhead nesting populations in the world.Since the early studies monitoring and conservation efforts have been undertaken by hard-working local rangers.In 2005 a three year project to assess and evaluate sea turtle populations in Masirah Island as well as establish a sustainable, general management plan for the Island and surrounding areas (Barr Al-Hikman and the Islands in the Masirah Channel) was initiated. One of the focal activities in 2006 is to track 10 nesting females to their possibly remote foraging areas as many years of flipper tagging have so far revealed very little of their migratory behaviour.A second project, with a further 10 transmitters will be undertaken in August by the Environment Society of Oman. Combining the information will strengthen the findings for appropriate conservation measures.\n",

      "\n",
      "From 1st July 2013 to 31st December 2013, Akazul conducted daily beach patrols across a 7.5 km study area and encountered a total of 67 dead sea turtles. Of these, 55 were <i>L. olivacea</i>, 11 were <i>C. mydas</i> and 1 was unknown. A peak of 35 dead turtles occurred in July where 28 olive ridley and 7 black sea turtles were recorded.

As well, ship-based visual surveys were conducted in the waters surrounding the Manu'a Islands, Rose Atoll, and Swains Island in the summer of 2006. A total of 52 groups of odontocete cetaceans were encountered during small boat surveys, including spinner dolphins (<i>Stenella longirostris</i>), rough-toothed dolphins (<i>Steno bredanensis</i>), sperm whales (<i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>), false killer whales (<i>Pseudorca crassidens</i>), bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops sp.</i>), dwarf sperm whales (<i>Kogia sima</i>), and unidentified odontocetes. A total of six groups of cetaceans were encountered during ship-based surveys, including false killer whales, pilot whales (<i>Globicephala macrorhynchus</i>), sperm whales, and unidentified odontocetes. Photographs, taken during both small boat and ship-based surveys, were analyzed for quality, and individuals with distinctive markings were selected for entry into the photo-identification catalogue. The resulting catalog includes 46 spinner dolphins, 41 rough-toothed dolphins, 2 bottlenose dolphins, 5 false killer whales, 4 pilot whales, 1 dwarf sperm whale, and 4 sperm whales. Thirteen (13) spinner dolphins and 14 rough-toothed dolphins were sighted in multiple years. For spinner dolphins, genetic data were used to estimate genetic diversity and effective population size and to compare these values with those of spinner dolphins in the Hawaiian Islands.  Diversity and populations size estimates were higher in American Samoa than in Hawai'i, suggesting a larger population size at American Samoa.\n",

The green turtle population was estimated at over 6.5 million turtles at the time of the discovery, and turtle fishing (turtling) came to form the basis of the economy and culture of the Cayman Islands. This historical importance is memorialized in our Coat of Arms and currency, but by the beginning of the 19th century, commercial exploitation had driven the immense green turtle nesting population in the Cayman Islands to the brink of extinction. Wild turtles continue have a central place in the memories and experiences of many of our citizens, but today, only a few dozen nesting sea turtles remain.

      "Four stocks of bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) have been described in the waters of North Carolina: the Northern Migratory (NM); Southern Migratory (SM); Northern NC Estuarine System (NNCES); and Southern NC Estuarine System (SNCES) stocks (Waring et al. 2013). The two migratory stocks occur in coastal shelf waters, but dolphins from the two estuarine stocks also occur in near-shore coastal waters. During summer, dolphins from both the SM and NNCES stocks are vulnerable to by-catch in small-mesh gill nets set in coastal waters, primarily gill nets set for Spanish mackerel very close to shore along the Outer Banks. Little is currently known about the degree of overlap of dolphins from these two stocks along the Outer Banks, which hampers our ability to assess the true impact of these by-catches. In this research project we photographed and collected biopsy samples of bottlenose dolphins from both the SM and NNCES stocks in coastal waters along the Outer Banks during the summer and early autumn of 2011 and 2012. We sampled dolphins from both stocks to determine: (1) their distribution patterns; (2) the degree of overlap between NNCES and SM stocks; and (3) specifically, how far from shore the NNCES animals are found. Almost all of the groups we encountered were from the SM stock; we only encountered four groups of NNCES dolphins during these surveys. In general, estuarine animals were observed in relatively small groups, close to shore, in shallow water and in relatively close proximity to an inlet.  Sighting and biopsy locations were significantly closer to shore (p=0.00278 and p=0.00091, respectively) and shallower (p=0.00117) for the NNCES stock than the SM stock. We note, however, that these conclusions should be tempered by the small sample of estuarine animals we observed. Nevertheless, all four sightings of estuarine dolphins occurred within 500-m of shore and in waters less than 4-m deep. The distribution of the two stocks overlapped in waters very close to shore, but we did not observe any estuarine groups beyond 500 m. from shore.\n",

      "Four female and one male black-footed albatross (<i>Phoebastria nigripes</i>) were tracked using satellite telemetry during their post-breeding summer dispersal (July - September, 1997-1999).    The females were tracked using transmitters that operated continuously, and the male was tracked using a duty-cycled transmitter programmed to transmit on 7-day ON:OFF cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "Albatross movements and foraging grounds during the post-breeding dispersal are poorly understood, despite their important conservation implications. We tracked four female black-footed albatross (<i>Phoebastria nigripes</i>) for 100 days during their summer (July-September, 1997-1999) post-breeding dispersal off California, and compared their movements to the distribution of fishing effort from the Japanese Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) longline fishery. The tracked birds foraged largely along the transition zone between the California Current and the Central Pacific Gyre, and spent 25, 24, and 51% of their time at sea within the 200 mile exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the USA and Mexico, and the high seas (international waters) respectively. The satellite-tracked birds occupied subtropical waters (18-20 °C) targeted by longline fisheries for tuna (<i>Thunnus</i> spp.) and broad-bill swordfish (<i>Xiphias gladius</i>), and ranged disproportionately farther during daylight hours, when tuna fisheries operate. The available data suggest that albatrosses overlap temporally and spatially with longline fisheries in the northeast Pacific Ocean. However, this research cannot directly evaluate whether black-footed albatross bycatch occurs in these fisheries. The coarse temporal (monthly) and spatial (1°×1°) resolution of the fisheries data, and the dynamic nature of the fishing effort inhibited a fine-scale analysis of albatross overlap with longline fisheries. While we documented substantial spatial overlap between albatross distributions and the Japanese Eastern Pacific Ocean longline fishing effort during the 1980s, we found no co-occurrence during the 1990s. This study illustrates the value of satellite telemetry to assess national conservation responsibilities, and to identify potential interactions of protected species with fisheries not currently monitored by observer programs. Furthermore, our results underscore the need to exercise caution when interpreting satellite telemetry data for conservation purposes, because of the highly dynamic nature of pelagic fisheries.\n",

Loggerhead turtle movements will be compared with the distributions of commercial fishing and dredging activity and results will be used to make management recommendations to protect adult loggerhead sea turtles and their habitats. A total of twelve satellite transmitters will be deployed from Jekyll (7) and Cumberland Islands (5).  Our tracking project also provides a unique educational opportunity for students to learn more about Georgia?s loggerhead turtles and the coastal marine ecosystems. During the spring of 2004, Sea Island, Georgia, will be the host of the historic G-8 Conference, where world leaders will meet to discuss important global economic issues. School kids from grades K-5 were given the opportunity to submit names for eight of the turtles.  Over 1,200 Georgia students in kindergarten through fifth grade took part in the sea turtle naming contest. Turtles were named in honor of the main eight countries participating in the G-8 Conference including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, France, Italy, Germany and Canada.  The winning children were then invited to take part in a special ceremony with Governor Sonny Perdue at the State Capitol.  Click on each individual turtle to get more information on the winning students.  There are wonderful stories behind the children and each name that was chosen.Our project will study the movements of Georgia?s adult loggerhead sea turtles during their nesting season (May-August), document their migratory movements and their  foraging habitats (home range) and then we will make a comparison with known fishing activity in the area.  \n",

      "The Olive Ridley turtle has a unique gene pool different from those sea turtles which nest along the Orissa coast, but little is known about this population. Thus we lack the ability to mitigate the effects of fisheries and other potential threats to this globally threatened species. Despite this, the political will and  necessary infrastructure to protect Olive Ridleys is just picking up  in India, and local attitudes towards sea turtles is just beginning to  change. Unfortunately, the resources available to protect Olive Ridleys are extremely limited. The TREE Foundation's Olive Ridley Satellite Tagging study provides practical information to guide sea turtle management and serves as a model for other  coastal states for leveraging the results of small-scale tracking projects into substantive management results. The first ever satellite telemetry study on this population of Olive Ridleys  will deploy 2 satellite telemetry tags on olive ridleys along the Chennai coast,  to determine their movements and turtle hotspots in the off shore waters.The Wildlife Wing of the Forest department and Department of Fisheries will then use the results of this study to inform the mechanized and trawl fishermen of the areas which are feeding grounds and congregations areas of the turtles to in order to request them to keep away from those areas during the turtle nesting season.Such enforcement can be implemented only through repeated awareness programs for the fishing community and general public.  Only then will the adult  nesting Olive Ridley as well as the juvenile Green turtle and Hawksbill population feeding in the off shore areas survive.TREE Foundation was founded on the principles of community involvement and ownership. The success of the programs is largely due to the day-to-day participation of the major stakeholders. Fishers who adapt their practices to sustain marine life are providing livelihoods for the next generation. Students who learn about the importance of marine ecosystems and conservation will grow to teach their children and grandchildren. STPF members are given incentives to become community leaders by training the next group of the Sea Turtle Protection Force. In these ways, we plan to ensure the programs of the TREE Foundation grow along with the communities they serve.To help ensure the sustainability of the conservation program, we are spearheading the efforts to unify conservation groups around the Bay of Bengal.  Over the next five years, sea turtle, marine mammal and ecosystem conservation groups from India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will come together under the umbrella group BEACON (Bay Of Bengal Ecologists and Conservationists Network) to provide support, standardize all database formats, share best practices and bring science to the common man, resulting in better law enforcement, protection for sustainable coexistence of man and megafauna and the health of the Bay as a whole.TREE Foundation was founded on the principles of community involvement and ownership. This is the main basis for sustainability of the program. STPF members are given incentives to become responsible future community leaders by training the next group of the Sea Turtle Protection Force. In these ways, we plan to ensure the programs of the TREE Foundation grow along with the communities they serve. One of the specific goals of the community based conservation program is to empower the present generation with the will and tools to ensure that sea turtles continue to survive. Specifically recruiting young fisher children, students from high schools and colleges is to get them involved in a life-long commitment to saving our ecosystem.

      "Satellite tagging projects provide new data that address a variety of applied science contexts. This year's collaborative partners include Mote Marine Laboratory, University of South Florida, Univ. Georgia, Univ. Alabama-Birmingham, Duke Univ., West Connecticut State Univ., Florida A&amp;M, Smithsonian, and National Geographic are all involved in various projects this nesting season.   A brief synopsis of the investigations includes:Acoustic Study: The acoustic effects of undersea exploration and of vessel traffic are currently unknown for free-ranging sea turtles.  The project will generate the first records of the acoustic environment of loggerhead sea turtles in inter-nesting habitats.  Nesting females will be equipped with an acoustic bioprobe and a time-depth recorder before they swim away for an internesting interval.  A recording tag will determine the acoustic environment experienced by turtles in the offshore environment. When a turtle returns to nest, the acoustic datalogger will be removed.  The data gleaned and refinement of methodology developed from a nearshore study is a prerequisite before any studies are attempted on acoustic environments experienced by turtles in offshore realms.  The project is a developmental step toward a more complete understanding of threats faced by sea turtles from boat traffic and opening Florida’s nearshore and offshore shelf to natural resource exploration.Clutch frequency study: In deriving population density and abundance estimates for a species, adequate sampling regimes are needed to obtain non-biased population parameters. The sampling of sea turtle populations generally occurs at rookeries for that proportion of reproductive females nesting in a given year.  Acknowledged problems inherent to adequately sampling these populations include tag loss, incomplete capture-recapture records, variation in remigration schedules, variable female reproductive output, and unrecorded nesting events occurring outside the sampling area.  A serious consequence of estimating female fecundity is to overestimate populations, which would be detrimental to the aims of the U. S. Loggerhead Recovery Team.To derive a more rigorous determination of clutch frequency, it is now possible to use satellite tags to evaluate how many nests a female may deposit within a season.  The methods require that females be instrumented early in the nesting season and followed through the reminder of all internesting intervals until a final nest and then a post-reproductive migration.  Although this is not the first time that loggerheads have been tagged in Florida nor in the Gulf of Mexico, all previous studies have generally tagged toward the end of the nesting season (July-August) and therefore would provide underestimates of annual fecundity.  This study proposes to determine clutch frequency of loggerheads at a primary nesting beach for loggerheads in the Gulf of Mexico.  Satellite tags as well as standard Inconel flipper tags and PIT tags will be attached to nesting female loggerheads at either Casey Key or Manasota Key during May.  Females will be tracked through the remainder of the nesting season to determine clutch frequency and site fidelity.  Other valuable research byproducts related to conservation will be the determination of internesting movement, exposures levels to red tide, and other risks faced during the internesting and post-nesting movements.  Pilot studies in 2005 and 2006 have previously determined the feasibility and logistics of such a study but were geared to tagging later in the season.  By deploying tags early in May, a more accurate determination of clutch frequency will be obtained.  These results would be comparable for other beaches in Florida, but are ideally suited to beaches that also conduct simultaneous night time tag patrols, such as on Manasota and Casey.\n",

      "A combination of visual line-transect survey, photo-identification (photo-ID), and automated acoustic monitoring methods is being used to gather important baseline information on the occurrence, distribution, and density of marine mammals near Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) and adjacent areas. The study area was chosen to cover areas where United States (U.S.) Navy activity is substantial, including Chesapeake Bay waters near Naval Station Norfolk, Joint Expeditionary Base (JEB) Little Creek (LC), and JEB Fort Story, as well as a Mine Exercise (MINEX) Area (W-50) in the Atlantic off the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Twenty-five line-transect surveys were completed in two zones (INSHORE and MINEX) between August 2012 and November 2013, with 2,810 kilometers (km) and 8,942 minutes completed on-effort. The majority of sightings were bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), although humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) were also sighted in the study area on occasion. In addition, loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) and leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) were sighted during the study period. Conventional line-transect analysis of bottlenose dolphin sightings showed both spatial and seasonal variation in density and abundance, with greatest abundance in the INSHORE zone during summer months. INSHORE densities were calculated as 3.05 individuals per square kilometer (km2) (N=948) in fall, 0.40 individuals per km2 (N=123) in winter, 1.09 individuals per km2 (N=337) in spring, and 3.52 individuals per km2 (N=1,094) in summer. MINEX densities were calculated as 0.11 individuals per km2 (N=105) in fall, 0.00 individuals per km2 (N=0) in winter, 0.10 individuals per km2 (N=90) in spring, and 0.16 individuals per km2 (N=148) in summer. A photo-ID catalog was created using photos taken during both dedicated photo-ID and line-transect surveys through July 2013; it contains 308 identified individuals to date. Thirty-three individuals were re-sighted; however, most sightings were less than three months and 15 km apart. Additional survey effort will be required before any clear movement patterns can be determined. C-POD acoustic data loggers (www.chelonia.co.uk) were deployed at four sites throughout the study area to cover areas of high U.S. Navy activity. Harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were detected in low numbers near NSN and JEB-LC during winter and spring deployments, and bottlenose dolphins were detected in each deployment location during all deployments from August 2012 to September 2013. Deployments, however, did not provide consistent coverage due to loss of gear. Further study is required to improve accuracy in seasonal density estimates and allow further stratification of those estimates, and to better describe the movement patterns and site fidelity of the bottlenose dolphins in these waters. Visual surveys and additional C-POD deployments are currently planned through August 2014.\n",

      " Please visit www.hawksbill.org for more information about efforts to research and protect hawksbill turtles in the eastern Pacific Ocean Make a list of the world's most endangered sea turtle populations. Is the eastern Pacific hawksbill on it? If not, it's no surprise. Essentially nothing is known of the biology, distribution, abundance, or conservation needs of this enigmatic population. Until recently, virtually nothing had been done to study what remains of these animals in the eastern Pacific, hunted nearly into extinction long before the start of the modern sea turtle conservation movement.  In 2005, the IUCN Marine Turtle Specialist Group recognized the lack of information about this population, listing it among global-scale critical research and conservation needs. According to communities and conservation projects in the region, some hawksbills do still remain in the eastern Pacific, but until recently, many thought it was too late to save hawksbills in this region. However, during the First Workshop on Eastern Pacific Hawksbills held in El Salvador in July 2008, it became clear that there were still a few nesting strongholds for the species in the region and that it was not too late to recover hawksbill turtles in the Eastern Pacific.Boding well for the turtles, more hawksbills are being reported now than were reported several decades ago a result of the increased protection afforded to sea turtles in the early 1990s, many local fishers believe. As explained by Juan de la Cruz, a former turtle hunter from a small fishing village on the shores of the Gulf of California, Mexico, thirty years ago it was almost impossible to see a hawksbill, because hunting of the species was rampant. Once the laws were established, the market for penca [tortoise shell] died, and seeking hawksbills became too risky. If people wanted to eat turtle meat, they trapped other turtles that were easier to capture.In spite of these recent discoveries and increased in-water hawksbill sightings, Jose Ovidio Perdomo, a life-long sea turtle egg collector turned conservationist, still has concerns about nesting hawksbills in the Biosphere Reserve of the Bahia de Jiquilisco, El Salvador, Although we are receiving hawksbills, their numbers have decreased significantly during my 40 years in the 'tortugueada' (search for sea turtle eggs), owed primarily to the extraction of eggs for consumption, beach development, and most recently, the use of explosives (as a fishing technique). I fear that if we don't change our path, my grandchildren will not know the hawksbills.Many questions remain, but the mysteries of this forgotten population are beginning to reveal themselves.  By shedding light on the biology and conservation status of the eastern Pacific hawksbill, we will provide critical information for local and regional conservation management plans that will ultimately determine the feasibility of the turtles recovery in this region of the world, hopefully transforming their vanishing act into a comeback.â€¨â€¨  For video and media coverage of this multi-national collaborative effort go to:<a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=kX-5-VzPNUU\">http://youtube.com/watch?v=kX-5-VzPNUU</a> â€¨<a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=iVVM5Zg0Nqo\">http://youtube.com/watch?v=iVVM5Zg0Nqo</a> â€¨<a href=\"http://www.laprensagrafica.com/nacion/1104272.asp\"> http://www.laprensagrafica.com/nacion/1104272.asp</a> â€¨â€¨<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/6comtd\"> http://tinyurl.com/6comtd&gt; http://tinyurl.com/6comtd&gt; http://tinyurl.com/6comtd</a><a href=\"http://www.numerounoonline.com/nota.php?id=3226\"> http://www.numerounoonline.com/nota.php?id=3226</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlfnXH-qa1g\"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlfnXH-qa1g</a>\n",

Several regional programmes are also based in the Philippines and are managed by GIZ from Manila. These include programmes supporting biodiversity conservation in the ASEAN area. One of these is the Sulu Sulawesi Marine Ecoregion project.Only a few regions in the world are as rich in species as the Sulu-Sulawesi Marine Ecoregion (SSME). It is part of the Coral Triangle region in the Pacific that spans a total of 640 million hectares between Indonesia, Malaysia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and the Solomon Islands. The natural resources of the region are exposed to considerable risk as a result of severe over-exploitation due to population growth, destructive fishing practices, rapid coastal development and other human activities. This situation is further exacerbated by climate change and its impacts, such as the rise in water temperatures and sea level, ocean acidification and an increase in the intensity and frequency of storms. The action plan of the SSME states of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines highlights the global importance and unique nature of the marine region in terms of biodiversity and natural resources.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Marine turtles are important components of the Sulu-Sulawesi Marine Ecoregion, (SSME). Green turtles are important for maintaining healthy seagrass beds and coral reefs. Without constant grazing, seagrass beds may become overgrown, obstructing currents, shading the bottom, or decomposing. Seagrass beds in turn are nurseries for a number of species of commercial fish and crustaceans, including shrimp. On coral reefs, green turtles crop algae that can compete with corals. Hawksbill turtles control the population of sponges in coral reefs, which can easily out-compete corals for the same space. Through selective foraging, hawksbill turtles are able to impact the overall reef diversity. Leatherback turtles eat large quantities amounts of jellyfish, helping to keep their populations under control. Jellyfish prey on larval fish, many species of which are economically important to humans. Loggerhead turtles are known to help recirculate sediments on the seabed and distribute nutrients while they search for, and feed on, crustaceans and molluscs. On the beach, unhatched eggs, trapped hatchlings, and egg shells provide nutrients for beach vegetation, which secures the sand via root development. The loss of beach vegetation can lead to erosion, minimizing sea turtle nesting habitat, among others, but also reducing coastal resilience.These same, ecologically important, marine turtles are threatened through ongoing egg harvests, poaching of adults by foreign fishing fleets, and as by-catch in shrimp and fish trawl fisheries. Work by the Marine Research Foundation (www.mrf-asia.org) estimated bycatch of turtles from the Sabah shrimp fleets alone at several thousand turtles each year. Recent reports by the Palawan Council for Sustainable Development and the Biodiversity Management Bureau (Philippines) have recorded several instances where Chinese fishing vessels have been apprehended with hundreds of adult and large juvenile turtles, and poaching in Malaysia and in Indonesia is on the rise. Another cause for concern lies a continued lack of knowledge of the biology and ecology of the turtles in many parts of the SSME - turtles spend 98% of their time at sea, but virtually all conservation efforts in the SSME only occur on land. The conservation of sea turtles is thus a key priority in the SSME. Sulu-Sulawesi turtles are recognised at both National and Regional levels, and even globally: turtles are similarly a priority under the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Sea Turtles and their Habitats (IOSEA MoU), the Coral Reef Triangle (CTI) Regional Action Plan, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Sea Turtle MoU. At the National level sea turtles are completely protected in all three countries bordering the SSME. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) lists marine turtles occurring in the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA) on Appendix I, while the World Conservation Union (IUCN) lists the green turtle as Endangered, and the hawksbill as Critically Endangered. The turtles nesting in the TIHPA area were included in the top-ten priority listing for conservation by the IUCN Marine Turtle Specialist Group, and as such are among priority focus areas of this conservation initiative.A network of protected areas to enhance sea turtle conservation in the Sulu Sulawesi was endorsed by Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines in 2010. The network was designed to link nesting turtles with development grounds, migration corridors and adult feeding grounds. Within the network, the most important nesting site for green and hawksbill turtles is the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA), a complex of nine islands shared by Malaysia and the Philippines. Thousands of turtles come to lay eggs on these islands each year, and they represent a valuable food and tourism commodity to local people and governments. But tailored conservation action relies on a thorough understanding of turtle population biology and ecology. One needs to know where turtles are in order to protect them. We need to know where they go as they disperse from nesting beaches, and where they grow up. We need to understand the relationship between nesting adults and developing populations, in order to understand the linkages among the various stocks. This project entails four inter-linked components to further the understanding of the biology and ecology of sea turtles in the SSME, upon which National policy decisions and the expansion of the Tri-National Network of Protected Areas may be based. Each component addresses critical biological and reproductive traits of turtles which have previously not been studied in the SSME, and together they form a cohesive research programme which complements National projects within the Sulu Sulawesi Tri-National Sea Turtle Corridor initiative.We are conducting laparoscopy and genetic studies to determine population structure through mixed stock analysis; tracking studies of post nesting female to determine foraging ground locations (this project component), and determining temporal habitat use in key foraging grounds in the SSME via aerial surveys.This project component will allow us to decipher the migration paths of marine turtles and linkages between foraging and nesting populations within the important Sulu-Sulawesi biogeographic region, and to raise awareness of the importance of marine turtle populations, and will track twenty post-nesting adult turtles as they depart from their nesting sites to determine the location of subsequent feeding zones and migratory routes using satellite technology. Data resulting from this work will inform managers of critical in–water habitats utilised by SSME turtles, and allow them to aim concerted conservation activities, including fishery regulation where applicable, to preserve turtles through all phases of their live cycle.\n",

      "The ecological decisions that influence hawksbill turtle migration are little understood and have not been investigated. Understanding the environmental and biological parameters that guide hawksbill migration (environmental features such as thermal fronts, sea surface currents and ocean depth) is key to understanding how hawksbill turtle populations may be able to cope with the adverse affects of climate change in the future. The only means by which this information currently can be obtained for migrating turtles at large is through satellite telemetry. Using ARGOS linked satellite transmitting units, an individual can be deployed and its locations tracked, environmental variables of its habitat obtained and a greater understanding of hawksbill migratory ecology gained. This information will then be used in conjunction with available information from other tracking studies to quantify the environmental “envelope” that Caribbean hawksbill turtles generally occupy. Future predicted changes in surface temperatures and currents can then be modeled more accurately and realisticallyTo date, no units have been deployed from the Dominican Republic, an island nation that receives a significant number of leatherback nests as well as hawksbill nests. The Dominican Republic is ideally situated to investigate the environmental parameters that may influence hawksbill migration: relatively central to the insular Caribbean, the Dominican Republic is surrounded by important Caribbean oceanographic features which may be important factors in determining the migratory paths.\n",

Moreton Bay, a large embayment in south-east Queensland, lies adjacent to one of the fastest growing regions in Australia and has a resident population of bottlenose dolphins, <i>Tursiops aduncus</i>. Evaluation of the effectiveness of any proposed management strategy requires robust population abundance estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "We estimated abundances of bottlenose dolphins in central eastern Moreton Bay (350 km2) using two commonly used abundance estimation methods for cetaceans: photo-identification mark-recapture and line-transect surveys. Mark-recapture data were analyzed in CAPTURE using a model that allowed capture probabilities to vary between sampling events and between individuals. Based on an estimated 76% of the population identifiable photographically, total abundance estimates were 673 ± 130 s.e. (1997) and 818 ± 152 s.e. (1998). Line-transect data, analyzed using DISTANCE, gave an abundance estimate of 407 ± 113.5 s.e. (2000). These abundance estimates are large compared with many other coastal bottlenose dolphin populations. The line-transect surveys comprised a pilot study, and the lower line-transect abundance estimate is probably best attributable to methodological issues. In particular, smaller mean group size was estimated for the line-transects surveys (2.85 ± 0.29 s.e.) than the mark-recapture surveys (4.87 ± 0.39 s.e., 1997; 5.78 ± 0.73 s.e., 1998), and line-transect group sizes were probably underestimated. In addition, the line-transect detection probability (g(o)) was assumed to be one but was almost certainly less than one. However, the possibility of an actual decline in population size cannot be ruled out. Coefficients of variation (CV) were lower for mark-recapture than for line-transect surveys, however, CVs of line-transect estimates could be lowered through improved survey design. We evaluated the power of these surveys to detect trends in potential population declines for bottlenose dolphins in Moreton Bay and make recommendations for ongoing monitoring strategies.\n",

      "Visit the nesting females at project id 1297http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/?project_id=1297The traditional owners of K'gari (Fraser Island), the Butchulla people, gained Native Title over much of K'gari in 2014, and we acknowledge their long heritage on and nurturing of this beautiful land, and wish them well with their new opportunities.The idea of monitoring nesting turtles in the Sandy Cape rookery on K'gari-Fraser Island was initiated in the 1992-3 season by Rowan Foley, a Butchulla, who was then employed as a Ranger by Queensland (National) Parks and Wildlife Service, (QNPWS, now QPWS) and as a result some nest and track-count monitoring was  undertaken by long-time annual campers Karl &amp; Sue Klein, and the Lighthouse Keepers, Dudley &amp; Sue Fulton, &amp; Aubrey Strydom &amp; Lainie Rowe. In the 1993-4 season Steve Price - QNPWS 2IC Ranger at Waddy Point, with the support of his RIC Bart Klekar, came to the top end of K'gari-Fraser Island with the two Michaels - volunteers from the Mon Repos Turtle Rookery.A number of Park Rangers and the Lighthouse Keepers were inducted into turtle I.D., tagging, and data sheet entry and so began an 18 year monitoring program, with a 17 night mid-season nesting census and flipper tagging of all turtles coming ashore during the census across the 44km of beach from Rooney Point to Ngkala Rocks.  In that first season the first nest relocation to near the Lighthouse gate by vehicle was trialed, using three doomed clutches laid below the king tide level.This was successful and since then 5 nest relocation cages with a total capacity of 120 clutches have been developed at strategic locations along the rookery, and recently also at Orchid Beach, to enable protection of doomed loggerhead and green clutches, and to provide protection for a percentage of loggerhead clutches from vehicle and camping impacts, and dingo and goanna (monitor lizard) depredation.In the first few years in the 1990's between 50 to 100 greens, but only 5 to 7 loggerheads were nesting annually, and drowned adult loggerhead turtles were being found washed up on the beach. Nesting numbers increased to twelve to fifteen loggerheads a year from 1997 when a seasonal 3 to 5 km wide trawl exclusion zone was established along the NW beach between Rooney Point and Sandy Cape, and then climbed to near 50 nesting each year after the introduction of TEDs, (Turtle Exclusion Devices) in the Queensland trawl fishery nets in 2001.Currently annually about 40 to 50 loggerheads nest along the 44 kilometers of the Rooney Point to Sandy Cape to Ngkala Rocks rookery, and between 50 and 100 loggerhead nests are protected by relocation each season, by the Sandy Cape Lighthouse Volunteer Caretakers, in a program supported by QPWS.Green nests are not generally relocated as the Southern Barrier Reef green turtle population is still slowly increasing since turtle protection in Queensland began in the early 1950s.While most commonly between 50 and 100 green turtles come in to nest each year, a factor that provides some protection to the greens is their pattern of sometimes alternatively flooding the predators one season with a mass nesting and starving them the next.  The largest cyclic influx of nesting green turtles saw them varying from over 600 nesting in the Sandy Cape rookery one season, to three nesting the nest season.A study of dingo impacts on the nests saw nest depredation vary between 15% in a season when there was a mass nesting of over 250 greens and 85% when there were only about 30 greens nesting. A potential new threat to the rookery is the advance of feral foxes up K'gari-Fraser Island.  They are in large numbers on the adjacent mainland and are good swimmers.Recently foxes have been sighted at Awinya Creek, only 30 to 40 kilometers from either end of the Sandy Cape rookery, and monitoring of nests for any fox impacts will guide management plans to provide further protection.Over the years since 1993 over 500 male green turtles were tagged courting in the shallows or basking on the beach, and a correlation between their numbers and the size of the concurrent green nesting season was observed.  Some were found to be carrying flipper tags from the Shoalwater Bay turtle rodeo program, and K'gari-Fraser Island tagged males were being found at Shoalwater Bay, and in the Whitsundays. It was found that female green turtles tagged on the Island in the September/October courting season were being seen that season nesting further north at other rookeries in the Southern Great Barrier Reef, and at the Wreck Rock mainland rookery. In 2014 two males were tagged while courting at Sandy Cape and one returned home to Shoalwater Bay and one to the outer Barrier Reef near Olympic Reef.The green female April O'Moreton, who had been tagged as a juvenile in 1992 in Moreton Bay was found courting at Sandy Cape in 2015 and given a satellite tracker, and she moved on to nest at North West Island in the Capricorn Bunker group. In the 2015-16 season the project also tracked 5 green males and in 2016-17 a further 6 green males, to expand the knowledge of where they come from to court at Fraser Island, what connectivity they have to other known courting areas, and to examine the areas in the Great Sandy Marine Park they use during their courting sojourn.Three females were tracked in the 2016-17 season - one with a history of nesting at K'gari-Fraser Island, one known to forage in the Whitsundays, and one known to nest at Wreck Island in 1998 in the Capricorn Bunker group.In November 2017, 3 nesting loggerhead females and 8 nesting green females were given trackers, to enable comparison of the female's inter-nesting habitat use with that of the males courting habitat, and help inform an assessment of the adequacy of the seasonal go-slow and no-trawl zones in the Great Sandy Marine Park.   \n",

      "Marine turtle populations around the globe are threatened through over-harvesting and habitat loss due to increased coastal development, urbanisation and industrialisation. Nowadays, critical measures are urgently needed to safeguard the turtle nesting sites, their feeding and breeding sites at sea, and their migratory pathways.But while we know a lot about turtle nesting sites, we know little about where they spend most of their lives: at sea. Today, critical measures are urgently needed to safeguard the few remaining turtle nesting sites, their feeding and breeding sites at sea, and their migratory pathways. The Marine Turtle Conservation Project focuses on 4 countries in the Gulf region: UAE, Oman, Qatar and Iran. The project links together numerous stakeholders, from Government agencies to NGOs to the private sector, and will combine scientific research and monitoring with environment awareness centered on marine turtle protection.  By tracking marine turtles at a regional scale, the project aims to raise the collective awareness of their plight, and provide concrete links at an international level on which these nations may develop concurrent conservation agendas.The objectives of the project are the following:•\tDevelop strategic partnerships amongst government agencies, NGOs and the private sector at both National and Regional levels;•\tRaise the awareness of marine turtle conservation needs at National and Regional levels;•\tElucidate the post-nesting migrations and biology of marine turtles using satellite tracking;•\tIdentify foraging grounds of endangered marine turtles and linkages between nesting and feeding population assemblages;•\tShare tracking data and findings to relevant authorities and contribute to the development of a regional marine turtle conservation plan;•\tIntegrate these conservation initiatives within international conservation agreements on marine turtles and national programmes.\n",

      "[ENGLISH]Argentina is the southernmost green turtle boundary of the West Atlantic Ocean. Early juveniles of this species inhabit the coastal waters of Argentina with evidence of the occurrence of green turtles along 2800 km of coastline; from Gualeguaychu (33º01'S, 58º30'W) to Puerto Piramides (42º34'S, 64º16'W). Individuals seem to be congregated at estuarine areas such as Samborombon Bay (34º- 36ºS to 55.5º- 57ºW) and Bahia Blanca estuary (38º- 35ºS to 61º- 62ºW) during the warm season. In Samborombon Bay, incidental capture of turtles in gillnets and marine debris ingestion have been detected as the main threats for this species. In the Bahia Blanca estuary, incidental capture in shrimp nets has been frequently recorded since 2003 and live turtles have been recovered since then. The turtles remain at the estuaries for an unknown period of time after which they migrate hypothetically to tropical latitudes. A broad understanding of the biology and ecology of this endangered species has not been achieved in this area yet. Simple questions such as how much time do the turtles spend in Argentine waters, where do they migrate next, what are they feeding on and how much of the turtles' distribution is overlapping with different anthropogenic activities are now beginning to be answered. The general goal of this project is to contribute to the conservation and knowledge of the green turtles in Argentina through community involvement and scientific research focused in their habitat use, movement patterns and feeding ecology.[ESPAÑOL]El Mar Argentino es el límite sur de la distribución de la tortuga verde en el Océano Atlántico Suroccidental. Juveniles tempranos de esta especie habitan a lo largo de 2800 km de costa, desde la ciudad de Gualeguaychu (33º01'S, 58º30'O) hasta Puerto Piramides (42º34'S, 64º16'O). La mayoría de los registros se concentra en zonas estuariales como el estuario de Bahía Blanca (38º- 35ºS to 61º- 62ºO) y la Bahía Samborombón (34º- 36ºS to 55.5º- 57ºO) durante los meses cálidos. En esta última, la captura incidental en redes de enmalle y la ingestión de residuos tales como bolsas de plástico han sido detectadas como el principal problema de conservación para esta especie. En el estuario de Bahía Blanca, la captura incidental en redes camaroneras ha sido registrada desde el año 2003, pudiéndose desde entonces recuperar los animales vivos para ser instrumentados con transmisores satelitales. Las tortugas permanecen en estos estuarios por un período de tiempo desconocido luego del cual migran hacia latitudes más cálidas al llegar el invierno. Se conoce muy poco acerca de la biología y ecología de esta especie en esta parte de su distribución. Preguntas tales como de qué se alimentan  en el Mar Argentino y cuánto se superponen sus desplazamientos con actividades antrópicas como la pesca están empezando a ser respondidas. El objetivo general de este proyecto es contribuir a la conservación y al conocimiento de las tortugas verdes juveniles del Mar Argentino a través del trabajo conjunto con la comunidad y la investigación científica de sus desplazamientos, uso de hábitat y alimentación. \n",

      "A combination of visual line-transect survey, photo-identification (photo-ID), and automated acoustic monitoring methods is being used to gather important baseline information on the occurrence, distribution, and density of marine mammals near Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) and adjacent areas. The study area was chosen to cover areas where United States (U.S.) Navy activity is substantial, including Chesapeake Bay waters near Naval Station Norfolk, Joint Expeditionary Base (JEB) Little Creek (LC), and JEB Fort Story, as well as a Mine Exercise (MINEX) Area (W-50) in the Atlantic off the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Twenty-five line-transect surveys were completed in two zones (INSHORE and MINEX) between August 2012 and November 2013, with 2,810 kilometers (km) and 8,942 minutes completed on-effort. The majority of sightings were bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), although humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) were also sighted in the study area on occasion. In addition, loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) and leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) were sighted during the study period. Conventional line-transect analysis of bottlenose dolphin sightings showed both spatial and seasonal variation in density and abundance, with greatest abundance in the INSHORE zone during summer months. INSHORE densities were calculated as 3.05 individuals per square kilometer (km2) (N=948) in fall, 0.40 individuals per km2 (N=123) in winter, 1.09 individuals per km2 (N=337) in spring, and 3.52 individuals per km2 (N=1,094) in summer. MINEX densities were calculated as 0.11 individuals per km2 (N=105) in fall, 0.00 individuals per km2 (N=0) in winter, 0.10 individuals per km2 (N=90) in spring, and 0.16 individuals per km2 (N=148) in summer. A photo-ID catalog was created using photos taken during both dedicated photo-ID and line-transect surveys through July 2013; it contains 308 identified individuals to date. Thirty-three individuals were re-sighted; however, most sightings were less than three months and 15 km apart. Additional survey effort will be required before any clear movement patterns can be determined. C-POD acoustic data loggers (www.chelonia.co.uk) were deployed at four sites throughout the study area to cover areas of high U.S. Navy activity. Harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were detected in low numbers near NSN and JEB-LC during winter and spring deployments, and bottlenose dolphins were detected in each deployment location during all deployments from August 2012 to September 2013. Deployments, however, did not provide consistent coverage due to loss of gear. Further study is required to improve accuracy in seasonal density estimates and allow further stratification of those estimates, and to better describe the movement patterns and site fidelity of the bottlenose dolphins in these waters. Visual surveys and additional C-POD deployments are currently planned through August 2014.\n",

Muscat and TOTAL Corporate Foundation for Biodiversity and the Sea are now sponsoring this Olive Ridley telemetry project.Olive ridley migration and behaviour are, in general, poorly studied and hence this project will provide vital information, not only for this population but for this species as a whole.Later, in the summer of 2008, a Green turtle telemetry project will take place at Masirah providing evidence of migration routes and raising awareness of this threatened and depleted population.\n",

      "The hawksbill population that nests in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) is considered the largest in the Atlantic and one of the four largest in the world. However, from about 6,400 registered annual number of nests in 1999 (when the Mexican population represented about 43% of all recorded hawksbill nests in the Greater Caribbean), the population's reproductive output dropped to less than 2,400 nests/yr by 2004. No single cause has been demonstrated but as major nesting sites are under protection this alarming decline (a drop of 63% in 5 years) is suspected to be associated with threats impacting the species at foraging grounds or migratory routes. Unfortunately not only has there been no capacity to study and protect these habitats but, with the exception of studies by Byles and Swimmer (1994) and Garduño et al. (2003), there is also insufficient information on the routes taken and foraging destinations for the various rookeries in the region. To address these issues, the current satellite tracking project was instrumented to reveal the post-nesting migratory behavior of hawksbills in the Yucatan Peninsula, starting in 2006 with animals nesting in Campeche State, where about 50% of the reproductive output by the species in the whole Peninsula is concentrated. Knowledge on the migratory routes and foraging sites will be helpful in identifying and mitigating potential threats in the marine habitats and for the establishment of research programs on the status of the habitats themselves. Furthermore, discovering whether or not these lie within or outside Mexican territorial waters has important consequences for the management strategies. If they are inside, the responsibility for addressing the hawksbills' conservation needs is totally Mexico's. If, on the other hand, some or all of the turtles cross into international waters or into other countries' jurisdictions it would indicate an internationally shared responsibility.Future studies by the group will be directed towards tracking hawksbills nesting in the two other sates using similar techniques and learning from the lessons obtained from this season's experience.Literature citedByles, R.

      "Satellite-monitored radio tags have yielded important information for the conservation and management of large whales. Tags provide far greater detail on large whale movements and habitat use than more traditional studies, and past tagging projects have revealed the existence of entirely unknown whale habitats. However, it is not uncommon for tags to stop transmitting within days to months of deployment, and follow-up studies on the individuals have been limited. Further work is needed to improve the scientific and conservation value of this technology. In this study, satellite tagging and its effects are being examined among Gulf of Maine humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). This is among the best studied humpback whale populations. Its strong fidelity to particular feeding sites, long feeding ground residency and strong overlap with observer effort that are expected to result in repeated sightings of tagged animals, and a maximized resighting potential in future years. The project will also produce new information on humpback whale movement and habitat use in relation to the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.\n",

      "On 6 July to 9 August 1992, as part of a larger study, Alaska harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) abundance was investigated during an aerial survey off the south side of the Alaska Peninsula. Employing a Twin Otter as the survey platform, the second of two identical sawtooth tracklines was flown at an altitude of 152.2 m (500 ft) and at an airspeed of 185 km/h. Line-transect methodology was used, and only those observations made during optimal conditions were analyzed.  Density of harbor porpoises was calculated using line transect estimates based on perpendicular distances of sightings to the cruise track of the airplane. On average, porpoise group size and density off the south side of the Alaska Peninsula was 1.1 (SE = 0.10) and 2.03 groups/100 km2 (SE = 1.65).\n",

      "Purpose:\n",
      "Although harbor porpoises, <i>Phocoena phocoena</i>, are known to occur throughout Alaska waters, few estimates of abundance exist. In 1991, the National Marine Mammal Laboratory initiated a 3 year study on Alaska harbor porpoises.  The objectives of this program were to: \n",
      "1) Obtain minimum population estimates in coastal waters using line transect methodology with a coefficient of variation for density estimates of less than 30% for each survey area, and\n",
      "2) Establish a baseline for detecting changes in abundance through time, for analysis of trends. \n",
      "During the present study, it was not fiscally possible to survey all areas of the state in any one year.

These surveys were initially designed to estimate abundance and distribution of commercial groundfish species, but since 1995 have also been regularly recording non-commercial species and invertebrates.

With the introduction of the Campelen trawl came a major change in the taxonomic detail recorded and by 2008 efforts were made to identify all fish to species, when possible. However although improved, identifications of some invertebrate taxa continue to be recorded at higher taxonomic levels.   Consequently  the absence of records for a particular species cannot be equated with an absence of the species, particularly when higher taxonomic classifications are present.\n",

This is a truly interdisciplinary project, bringing together biologists studying living systems and oceanographers studying marine physics. The maritime expeditions of the Australian sea lions are now yielding data that are important to both biologists and oceanographers and refining our understanding of the intimate connections between the mechanics of the Earth’s oceans, and the complex ecosystems which dwell within and upon them. This is an extremely cost-effective means of adding to existing global oceanographic data archives. It has the potential to complement existing sampling methods, especially for regions from which data are scarce and where these alternative methods may be difficult or prohibitively expensive to implement.  Importanly, this approach provides a mechanism of targeting the collection of physical oceanographic data from regions that are biologically of interest (ie. where high trophic level predators feed), therefore providing greater insights into how physical ocean processes underpin marine ecosystems and commercial fisheries.\n",

The green turtle population was estimated at over 6.5 million turtles at the time of the discovery, and turtle fishing (turtling) came to form the basis of the economy and culture of the Cayman Islands. This historical importance is memorialized in our Coat of Arms and currency, but by the beginning of the 19th century, commercial exploitation had driven the immense green turtle nesting population in the Cayman Islands to the brink of extinction. Wild turtles continue have a central place in the memories and experiences of many of our citizens, but today, only a few dozen nesting sea turtles remain.

      "Large whale strandings have always been intriguing to people through the centuries. The size and strangeness of these events always attracted popular attention and were, later on, a source for food, oil and other products. Our goal was to document species occurrence over time along the mainland coast of Portugal through the use of historical records as they can provide useful information on cetaceans' species. A total of 38 historical records from the 16th to the 20th Centuries were collected from several Portuguese institutes and personal archives. Results show an increasing awareness of the scientific importance of strandings reflected throughout the years in number and in the detail of the strandings. The most common stranded species recorded was <i>Physeter macrocephalus</i> followed by <i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>. Even though historical stranding records are sparse for mainland Portugal, the information gathered indicates a high diversity of cetaceans. We also addressed the evolution of the historical records in aspects such as in number of records, description detail, pictures' content and scientific accuracy. We were able to establish relationships linking strandings, local fishing communities, the general public, and particularly the contribution of early 20th Century zoologists. Results indicate that reports made by local fishing communities and the role of naturalists and science journals of the 19th and early 20th Centuries was of considerable relevance to the present knowledge about cetaceans, giving an important contribution to modern day cetacean studies.\n",

      "This project aims to find out more about the post nesting migratory movements of loggerhead sea turtles from Bald Head Island, North Carolina. Four nesting females were tracked each in 2003 through 2006 and made impressive movements north, using waters as far away as New Jersey. All four of the transmitters from 2006 are still transmitting. The transmitters provided us with some interesting, novel and useful data about the migratory and foraging behaviour and natural history of the loggerhead sea turtle in this region. This summer's deployments will complement the results from previous years and provide us with a wider insight into North Carolina sea turtle biology.\n",

      "From 4 to 13 August 1991, as part of a larger study, Alaska harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) abundance was investigated during an aerial survey throughout the coastal waters of Bristol Bay. A Twin Otter was used as the survey platform. The surveys were flown at an altitude of 152.2 m (500 ft) and at an airspeed of 185 km/h. A single zigzag trackline was flown along the north side of Bristol Bay, and the first of three identical sawtooth tracklines was flown along the south side. Line-transect methodology was used, and only those observations made during optimal conditions were analyzed. Density of harbor porpoises was calculated using line transect estimates based on perpendicular distances of sightings to the cruise track of the airplane. On average, porpoise group size and density for Bristol Bay was 1.17 (SE = 0.35) and 4.48 groups/100 km2 (SE = 1.38).\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "Although harbor porpoises, <i>Phocoena phocoena</i>, are known to occur throughout Alaska waters, few estimates of abundance exist. In 1991, the National Marine Mammal Laboratory initiated a 3 year study on Alaska harbor porpoises. The objectives of this program were to: \n",
      "1) Obtain minimum population estimates in coastal waters using line transect methodology with a coefficient of variation for density estimates of less than 30% for each survey area, and \n",
      "2) Establish a baseline for detecting changes in abundance through time, for analysis of trends.\n",
      "During the present study, it was not fiscally possible to survey all areas of the state in any one year. Accordingly, we selected sections of the state to survey in consecutive years to maximize the likelihood of including all of the animals for a particular area surveyed while minimizing the likelihood of significant movement between areas among survey years.\n",

      "Thirty-eight sightings of sperm whales (<i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>) were recorded off Peru (3 degrees S - 18 degrees S) during 21 surveys conducted aboard platforms of opportunity between 1995 and 2002, with a search effort of 33,406.6 nautical miles of observation. Two main areas of concentration were detected: northern Peru (19 sightings) and southern Peru (16 sightings), but seasonality could not be confirmed. Almost 58% of sightings occurred during the same or consecutive days. Group size ranged from 1 to 18 individuals, with a mean of 3.5 individuals (SD = 3.9). The modal group size was one, with single whales accounting for 36.8% of sightings.  Groups of three or more individuals accounted for 39.5%. An important increase of sightings occurred between 2001 and 2002, accounting 68% of the records, suggesting migratory movements towards Peruvian waters from other regions of the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n",
      "Positive correlations between indices of relative abundance and the anomaly of sea surface temperature were found, although warm events as El Niño appear to increase the uncertainty in sighting rates, reducing correlation values. Positive relationship between indices of relative abundance and fishery's CPUE of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i> suggest some grade of interaction, although the question about the role of <i>D. gigas</i> in the diet of sperm whales in the area must be solved for further conclusions. It is priority to perform specific surveys for population estimation, as well as non-lethal research about feeding and the effect of the fishery competition over sperm whales.\n",

      "Marine turtle populations around the globe are threatened through over-harvesting and habitat loss. In the Gulf region, marine turtles have provided food at a subsistence level to fisherman and coastal dwellers since time immemorial. Evidence of this dates back five thousand years! Turtles have also been used traditionally for their fat and meat, and their eggs have fed families dependent on the bounty of the sea. But with increased coastal use and industrialization, and the advent of outboard motors and access to distant markets, the loss of turtles and their eggs has reached a level from which populations are struggling to recover. Turtle eggs, which used to be collected on an occasional, irregular basis, are now collected nearly every single time a nesting female emerges on the beach. Of even greater concern is the increased coastal development - industrialization and urbanization have resulted in severe habitat loss and alteration, and industrialised fisheries, which decimate turtles while at sea, continue to grow. Today, critical measures are urgently needed to safeguard the few remaining turtle nesting sites, their feeding and breeding sites at sea, and their migratory pathways.The project links together numerous stakeholders, from Government agencies to NGOs to the private sector, and will combine scientific research and monitoring with environment awareness centered on marine turtle protection – and bring about regional change –positive change resulting in long-term conservation of marine turtles.This project, using capacity building, awareness raising and satellite tracking and monitoring of marine turtles in the Gulf region as operational building blocks, aims to develop a marine turtle conservation action plan through the results of a three year project with the following objectives:•\tDevelop strategic partnerships amongst government agencies, NGOs and the private sector at both National and Regional levels;•\tRaise the awareness of marine turtle conservation needs at National and Regional levels;•\tElucidate the post-nesting migrations and biology of marine turtles using satellite tracking;•\tIdentify foraging grounds of endangered marine turtles and linkages between nesting and feeding population assemblages;•\tShare tracking data and findings to relevant authorities and contribute to the development of a regional marine turtle conservation plan;•\tIntegrate these conservation initiatives within international conservation agreements on marine turtles and national programmes.\n",

      "When Christopher Columbus discovered the Cayman Islands in 1503, he named them Las Tortugas (the turtles). Ferdinand Columbus recounted that the islands were ?full of tortoises, as was all the sea about, insomuch as that they looked like little rocks? The green turtle population was estimated at over 6.5 million turtles at the time of the discovery, and turtle fishing (turtling) came to form the basis of the economy and culture of the Cayman Islands. This historical importance is memorialized in our Coat of Arms and currency, but by the beginning of the 19th century, commercial exploitation had driven the immense green turtle nesting population in the Cayman Islands to the brink of extinction. Wild turtles continue have a central place in the memories and experiences of many of our citizens, but today, only a few dozen nesting sea turtles remain. Where do these endangered greens and loggerheads go after they leave our beaches? With the help of schools and the community, the Cayman Islands Department of Environment and the Marine Turtle Research Group have begun a satellite telemetry project to track our historically and culturally important sea turtles for the first time.\n",

      "The main purpose of this study is to know how a rehabilitated harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) reintegrates his natural habitat. CHENE is a rehabilitated center for all wildlife. Each year, we take care of harbors, useally young ones, coming from beach in the north of France (from Baie du Mont-Saint-Michel to Dunkerque). Generally these youngs arrive because of the separation from the mother just before weaning or because they cannot find sufficient food for their energy requierements just after it weaning. Others arrive because of injuries or deseases.It is important to know what happene for these animals after release. This study provides us information about their movement patterns and their behaviour. The tag gives us different kind of data : dive depths, dive durations and haultout. L'objectif principal de cette étude est de connaître le devenir des phoques veaux-marins (Phoca vitulina) soignés, une fois de retour dans leur mileu naturel.Le CHENE est un centre de sauvagarde de la faune sauvage. Chaque année nous accueillons des phoques, souvent des jeunes, provenant des plages de la côte nord de la France (de la Baie du Mont-Saint-Michel à Dunkerque).La pluspart du temps, les jeunes que nous accueillons arrivent au centre à cause d'une séparation prématurée d'avec la mère, avant le sevrage, ou à cause de difficultés à s'alimenter juste après le sevrage. Certains arrivent également suite à des contusions ou des maladies.Il est important pour nous de savoir ce que deviennent ces animaux après leur lâcher. Cette étude nous apporte des informations sur leurs déplacements et aussi sur leur comportement. Les balises enregistrent différentes informations : profondeur et durée des plongées et le temps passé au sec.\n",

      "The United States (US) Navy proposed constructing an Undersea Warfare Training Range (USWTR) along the US Atlantic coast. One of the proposed sites within the Cherry Point (CHPT) OPAREA is an area of 1,713 km2 in Onslow Bay, 87 km from the coast of North Carolina. As part of the Navy's Atlantic Fleet Training and Testing (AFTT) Monitoring Program, shipboard and aerial line transect surveys were implemented in 2007 to estimate density and document distribution and seasonal residency of marine mammals and sea turtles in the proposed USWTR (see <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/datasets/detail/433\">\"DUML vessel-based line transect surveys for proposed Onslow Bay USWTR site 2007-2010\"</a> dataset). Shipboard line-transect survey methods transitioned to biopsy and photo-identification sampling at the end of April 2011 to address questions of residency and population structure in the CHPT OPAREA. Survey effort was expended along the 200 m depth contour and occasionally around eddies and fronts generated by the Gulf Stream. We are focusing on residency and population structure with our shipboard surveys because we are: \n",
      "(1) obtaining adequate data with which to estimate density from aerial line transect sampling;\n",

      "The New England Aquarium (NEAq) has been rehabilitating stranded sea turtles for more than twenty years. The majority of sea turtles that are treated at NEAq come from annual cold stun stranding events on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA. Each fall and winter, juvenile and sub-adult sea turtles strand on Cape Cod beaches after experiencing cold-stunning. Cold stunning, or hypothermia, in sea turtles is thought to occur when water temperature quickly drops below 50ºF (10ºC). Sudden cooling of ocean water temperatures leaves the turtles torpid and floating at the surface, unable to swim or dive, and allows them to be pushed by strong sustained storm winds onto the windward shore. Since the 1980s, NEAq has worked with the Massachusetts Audubon Society’s Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary (WBWS) to save these threatened and endangered species. NEAq has recently begun using satellite telemetry to study the post release survivorship of these rehabilitated turtles.  Our primary goal is to learn about the survivorship of these animals. We will also be studying and observing their habitat use and migration routes post-release.We wish to thank the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries for their continued support of the Massachusetts Sea Turtle Network. In addition we would like to thank our volunteers and the kind folks at the Cross Sound Ferry for their dedication and continued support to the preservation of sea turtles and other marine life.\n",

      "Satellite-monitored radio tags have yielded important information for the conservation and management of large whales.  Tags provide far greater detail on large whale movements and habitat use than more traditional studies, and past tagging projects have revealed the existence of entirely unknown whale habitats.  However, it is not uncommon for tags to stop transmitting within days to months of deployment, and follow-up studies on the individuals have been limited. Further work is needed to improve the scientific and conservation value of this technology.In this study, satellite tagging and its effects are being examined among Gulf of Maine humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). This is among the best studied humpback whale populations.  Its strong fidelity to particular feeding sites, long feeding ground residency and strong overlap with observer effort that are expected to result in repeated sightings of tagged animals, and a maximized resighting potential in future years.  The project will also produce new information on humpback whale movement and habitat use in relation to the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.\n",

The knowledge gained from such tracking will enable us to better understand the routes of these species. This will then allow us to improve conservation strategies for the benefit of these ancient travelers. The first tagging of this project was made in March 2013 within the protected waters of Gorgona Island National Park, located  56 km (44 miles) off  Colombia’s Pacific coast. This excursion was led by Dr. Diego Amorocho, WWF Species Program Coordinator for Latin America and the Caribbean, with the help of biologists Alexander Tobón and Juan S. Ayala and documented by Molly Edmonds from WWF-US.Two juvenile hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata)--“Celeste” and “Mateo”--were captured at La Azufrada reef. They were each fitted with a SPOT5 transmitter attached with an epoxy solution and later released in Playa Blanca reef.

El uso de telemetría nos ofrece un gran apoyo, para responder a preguntas esenciales para el manejo y la conservación de las tortugas marinas, así como comparar nuestros resultados con  otras poblaciones de tortugas en el mundo.Considerando la importancia de este tipo de estudios el Gobierno Municipal de Los Cabos, B.C.S. a través de su Programa para Protección de Tortugas Marinas de la Dirección Municipal de Ecología, con el apoyo de la Alianza  WWF-Telcel y CONANP, en el año del 2009 dieron inicio al al proyecto “SEGUIMIENTO VÍA SATÉLITE DEL DESPLAZAMIENTO DE TORTUGA GOLFINA (Lepidochelys olivacea), ANIDANDO EN LOS CABOS, BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR - MÉXICO.”, debido a la poca información con la que se cuenta para esta especie con respecto a sus movimientos y rutas migracionales en Los Cabos, los datos que se obtengan del seguimiento del desplazamiento de las tortugas que sean estudiadas, podrán servir de base para futuras decisiones en cuanto a conservación y manejo. Desde entonces se ha dado seguimiento a 8 tortugas golfinas.En el mes de noviembre del 2012 el Gobierno Municipal en coordinación con el Hotel Esperanza dieron continuidad al proyecto de seguimiento vía satélite liberando en el mes de noviembre en playas del hotel Esepranza en Los Cabos a una tortuga hembra adulta a la que le fue instalado un transmisor satelital y a la cual le llamaron “ESPERANZA.Aundado al seguimiento El Programa de Protección a la Tortuga Marina con la ayuda de ESPERANZA dan continuidad a un proyecto educativo en el cual a través del seguimiento satelital de esta tortuga se realizaran actividades que están diseñadas principalmente para los grados de 3º a 6º de primaria, y que pueden ser adaptadas para niveles superiores o inferiores. Todas y cada una de las actividades han sido correlacionadas con los programas de estudio de la Secretaría de Educación Pública. Además, muchas son interdisciplinarias e incluyen español, matemáticas, historia, ciencias sociales, así como conocimientos y habilidades científicas.Cada una de estas actividades está diseñada para realizarse independientemente, durante el seguimiento de Esperanza a través de internet o simplemente como una experiencia posterior. Cada actividad presenta al inicio una o varias preguntas que promueven la participación de sus alumnos en una lluvia de ideas, para despertar interés en el tema, para fomentar el hábito de la investigación, para permitir que sus alumnos compartan con los demás lo que ya saben, para que hagan más preguntas y juntos busquen las respuestas y disfruten del proceso Enseñanza - Aprendizaje, recordando siempre que el proceso de llegar a una conclusión es tan importante como la conclusión misma. Con esto ESPERANZA se convierte en una invaluable tortuga no solo para conocer su biología, sino para ayudarnos a enseñar dentro de las aulas. Siendo este un programa innovador (el primero en su tipo) y realmente divertido para los jóvenes.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Sea turtles throughout the world's oceans are endangered and species such as the leatherback and hawksbill turtles of the eastern Pacific are nearing extinction. Both critically endangered leatherbacks and hawksbills, as well as olive Ridley and Pacific green sea turtles nest along the Pacific beaches of southern Nicaragua.  Since 2008, Paso Pacifico has been working with local community members to monitor and protect nesting sea turtles in southwestern Nicaragua.Due to the pervasiveness of rural poverty and the traditional culture of sea turtle eggs as food, sea turtle nests left unprotected on the beaches of Nicaragua, will almost certainly be poached.  Paso Pacifico employs a group of community-based sea turtle rangers to monitor and protect nesting sea turtles and act as ambassadors for the environment within their local communities.  La Flor Wildlife Refuge is a protected area located in southwestern Nicaragua, established to safeguard one of the region's most important arribada (mass nesting) beaches for the olive Ridley sea turtle. Along the more isolated of these beaches, where the Nicaraguan Ministry of the environment could not deploy their own rangers, we employ full-time rangers who work at a competitive wage and with benefits. For many of these rangers, this is their first formal employment, and several of them were formerly turtle poachers.  In one year, Paso Pacifico's sea turtle conservation program protected 438 nests resulting in nearly 30,000 successfully hatched turtles. These nests were the first in the city of Ostional to survive turtle egg poachers and yield live offspring in 25 years. However, egg poaching is not the only threat to nesting turtles in Nicaragua: there are high mortality rates among adult sea turtles caught in fishing gear as they gather to mate. Now, with support from the Danish International Cooperation Agency (DANIDA), our turtle rangers are satellite tagging turtles so that we can better understand the threats to sea turtles that nest in the La Flor Wildlife Refuge of southwestern Nicaragua, as part of our new Coastal-Marine Research Project.  Launched in September 2011, this project is designed to contribute to the scientific understanding of sea turtle populations and marine ecology.  Paso Pacifico's Coastal-Marine Research Project trains local marine biologists, maps reefs and turtle habitat, and ensures protection of newly discovered turtle nesting beaches, allowing more critically endangered sea turtles to safely nest than ever before.As part of our Marine Turtle Conservation Program, we will satellite tag six green and hawksbill turtles and follow their movements over the next several months, so that we can identify their home ranges and determine the fisheries most likely to impact the conservation of sea turtles nesting in southwestern Nicaragua.\n",

      "There is updated information on abundance and distribution of cetaceans in the central coast of Venezuela, where is needed baseline information in order to manage dolphin-watching activities. Between March 2006-January 2007, 28 surveys were made aboard small boats, powered with outboard engines, totaling 71.5 h of effort. The presence of Atlantic spotted (Stenella frontalis), bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) dolphins and Bryde´s whales (Balaenoptera edeni) was confirmed. Cetaceans were found on 71.4% of the surveys. Relative abundance, expressed as number of individuals found per Km of transect line and hour of survey effort were 6 (± S.D. 12) and 26 (±S.D. 42), respectively, for S. frontalis and 1 (± S.D. 1) and 3 (±S.D. 2), respectively, for T. truncatus. Group size ranged from 6-400 individuals (mean 120 ± S.D. 119) and from 1-20 individuals (mean 8 ±S.D 7) for S. frontalis and, T. truncatus respectively. Some level of differentiation in habitat preference for these two species was found, with bottlenose dolphins preferring coastal waters over the 100m isobath, and Atlantic spotted dolphins preferring deeper waters around the 200m contour. Balaenopterid whales were found in March 2006, probably a cow-calf pair, Balaenoptera sp., and in October 2006, adult B. edeni.\n",

We expect that WW activities will soon be successful at a commercial level, so we decided to generate data on the biological and ecological aspects of the three cetacean species presents in the coast of Aragua (Stenella frontalis, Tursiops truncatus and Balaenoptera edeni). This information will provide a basis for future comparisons about population aspects as well as responsible management of this activity in the region as well as in the country.\n",

      "As part of Component 5 of the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Project (SWIOFP; http://www.swiofp.net), three Loggerhead turtles (named “Lurdes”, “Esperança” and “Mingas”)  nesting at the Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (POPMR) were satellite tagged (Telonics Argos Marine Transmitters TAM-2639).The loggerhead turtles had contrasting migratory routes: Lurdes immediately initiated a near-shore northbound migration, travelling approximately 634 km (monitored distance) during the 15-day monitoring period and probably the turtle was poached, as the last signal from the tag was sent from 2 km inland next to a hut, closed to Baía dos Cocos in Inhambane Province, Mozambique. Mingas was monitored for 73 days and similarly traveled along the coast, all the way to Mozambique Island and across the Mozambique Channel to the NE coast of Madagascar, traversing 3,270 km (ca 2,025 km straight distance).Finally, Esperança was tracked for 2,608 km during 187 days. This turtle travelled along the coast approximately 250 km north (straight distance) of the nesting beach and reached, what is believed to be her feeding grounds on the Mozambique coast between Macaneta and Xai-Xai. This results shows that despite being protected nationally and internationally, poaching is still a serious threat to the conservation of marine turtles in Mozambique (and in the region), which warrants further efforts for their protection.\n",

Methods included aerial and boat surveys, interviews with local fishermen, and radio-tagging. Bryde's whales, apparently attracted by the abundance of food, were observed in the area between March and December; numbers were greatest in fall. Distribution within the study area varied with season: between march and August the whales were seen in the eastern part; from August to December in the western. Herd size increased from march through October. Although several cow and calf pairs were seen, breeding activities were not, and there is no evidence that this is a breeding area.\n",

      "Endangered North Pacific loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) are distributed widely throughout the North Pacific Ocean.  Scientists have known that juvenile loggerhead turtles originating from Japanese nesting beaches cross the Pacific Ocean to access the productive waters off the Pacific Coast of North America, although the movements of these loggerhead turtles in U.S. waters of southern California are poorly understood. This project's goal is to track the movements of juvenile loggerheads in this portion of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem.  Understanding their movement patterns, and how they relate to oceanographic conditions in the region will provide significant information for management efforts aimed at reducing human impacts to loggerheads in this area.\n",

At Wunjunga Beach, just south of Townsville in Queensland, scientists are continuing their study to identify the migration pathways, diets and critical foraging habitats of this vulnerable turtle.In November 2014, four satellite transmitters were attached to nesting flatback turtles originating from Wunjunga Beach. Another six have been deployed during the 2014-2015 nesting season from the same location.Complementary to the information acquired by satellite tracking, stable isotope collection and analysis of carbon (&#948;13C) and nitrogen (&#948;15N) will assist us to determine the flatbacks’ diet, if there are one or more foraging grounds, and their migration paths.Sampling the foraging grounds will also help us to determine flatback habitat type and diet preference.There are many studies that show how marine turtles are being adversely affected by environmental change. With so little known about the flatback turtle, it is a priority that we identify their key foraging habitats and monitor their presence at nesting beaches, to gauge their responses to a changing environment.\n",

      "In its current form the project consists of a collaborative effort between Dubai’s Wildlife Protection Office (WPO) and the Jumeirah Group. It evolved from a small-time operation using fish quarantines, available locally for the occasional turtle stranding, but in 2010 alone, over 350 turtles have passed through the project and have been released into the sea. At the outset of the collaboration, the co-chairman of the Marine Turtle Specialist Group was brought in by WPO to ensure that the project followed best practice guidelines in terms of turtle handling, rehabilitation and release protocols.Sea turtles received consist of three species, The hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata, the green Chelonia mydas and the loggerhead Caretta caretta. Although we have received turtles up to 150Kg, by far the majority of the cases we receive are juvenile hawksbills of around 1kg in weight. An ever-increasing local awareness of our project has led to more turtles being received by the project, primarily in the season from January to April, when local waters can be down to 16C. Many of the turtles passing through our hands are due to the efforts of Emirates Marine Environmental Group, TDIC and Dubai Municipality’s Environment Section, as well as contributions from individuals.Central to the success of the project is the veterinary work provided by our colleagues at the Dubai Falcon Hospital. Original contributions and protocols for turtle receipt and treatment from Peter McKinney in the late 90’s have subsequently seen contributions from numerous successive veterinarians. Mirjam Hampel has recently left us for work in Europe, but in her time with the project she contributed enormously to the development of the project. Some of our combined work may be viewed in Wildlife Middle East articles, available online. We have also been joined by Valentina Caliendo, who brings to us her experiences of working with cold-stunned individuals in the Mediterranean and Adriatic and most recently Conor Kilgallon who is now offering his veterinary expertise.Dubai’s Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (CVRL) provides support in terms of pathology, bacteriology and follow-up blood work.Although much of our work is behind closed doors, Jumeirah Group has donated two large penned areas located at Madinat Jumeirah, which are used by the project as pre-release pens. This provides an important chance to observe behaviour of the turtles immediately prior to release. It also provides a first-class interface between the public and the turtles, contributing greatly to local awareness. In excess of 1000 school children visit the project annually and receive guided tours and information on the turtles.The release pen is furnished with an artificial reef donated by Amusement White Water. This provides environmental enrichment to the animals within, and allows us to observe the turtle’s forage behaviour.The Jumeirah Group has also provided all funding for the eleven satellite tags deployed to date. This provides us with the very exciting opportunity to monitor our turtles post-release. Our 2008 release, Dibba, brought fascinating data back, on its travels from UAE’s East coast to the last known position close to Thailand (8600km). We choose to share all this information via Seaturtle.org in order to contribute to the growing awareness and knowledge of turtle behaviour.The day to day project management is from Wildlife Protection Office’s Kevin Hyland and from Burj al Arab’s Aquarium Management Warren Baverstock and David Robinson.\n",

      "Dirk Hartog Island Loggerhead Turtle Tagging:Dirk Hartog Island, covering 63,000 hectares is Western Australia’s largest island, forming a protective barrier to the shallow waters of Shark Bay. The Loggerhead turtle rookery at Turtle Bay on the north coast of the island is Western Australia’s largest and is of international significance. The Island and Bay are part of the Shark Bay World Heritage Property protected for its significant ongoing geological and biological processes and habitats for a number of threatened species. To the north lies the Ningaloo Reef, Australia’s largest fringing coral reef, boasting spectacular coral formations, abundant fishes and species with special conservation significance such as turtles, whale sharks, dugongs, whales and dolphins. Ningaloo Marine Park was first gazetted in 1987 to recognise and protect this diverse biological hotspot with amendments made to park boundaries on 30 November 2004 to encompass the whole of the Ningaloo Reef. The Department of Parks and Wildlife is the primary manager of these reserves. Dirk Hartog Island, Shark Bay, the Muiron islands and the beaches of the Ningaloo coast provide an important habitat and relatively undisturbed nesting area for the loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles between November and March each year. Flatback and leatherback turtles have also been recorded foraging occasionally along this coast. In recognition of these important and diverse reserves, the Ningaloo Reef and surrounding area was bestowed the highest level of international recognition with its inscription on the World Heritage List for its natural beauty and biological diversity in June 2011. The Ningaloo World Heritage Area encompasses 604,500ha in total, including the Muiron Islands Marine Management Area, Ningaloo Marine Park, Cape Range National Park, the Learmonth Air Weapons Range and Bundegi and Jurabi Coastal Parks. The nesting range of loggerhead turtles in Western Australia extends from Dirk Hartog Island in the south to the Muiron Islands in the north, with important rookeries in between, including Gnaraloo Bay, Cape Farquhar, Janes Bay and Bungelup in the Ningaloo Marine Park. Satellite tagging at Dirk Hartog Island is part of a broader coordinated program in the 2015/16 season to understand inter-nesting movements, post-nesting migration, identify foraging grounds and potential threats across their entire nesting range in Western Australia with loggerhead turtles also tagged at South Muiron Island and Gnaraloo.\n",

This year we return to investigate these strategies, specifically to determine whether large adult turtles, discovered last year to feed off the coast of Guinea and Sierra Leone, employ a different strategy from smaller adult turtles that feed in the open ocean. The turtles will again be given special Creole names by local students. Creole is the local dialect. The nesting population of Cape Verde has been identified as a priority for conservation along the West Coast of Africa and more information needs to be collected on its natural history, including migratory pathways and foraging areas.

      "On 6 July to 9 August 1992, as part of a larger study, Alaska harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) abundance was investigated during an aerial survey off the south side of the Alaska Peninsula. Employing a Twin Otter as the survey platform, the first of two identical sawtooth tracklines was flown at an altitude of 152.2 m (500 ft) and at an airspeed of 185 km/h. Line-transect methodology was used, and only those observations made during optimal conditions were analyzed.  Density of harbor porpoises was calculated using line transect estimates based on perpendicular distances of sightings to the cruise track of the airplane. On average, porpoise group size and density off the south side of the Alaska Peninsula was 1.1 (SE = 0.10) and 2.03 groups/100 km2 (SE = 1.65).\n",

      "The second phase of the three-year project “Monitoring and Conservation of Important Sea Turtle Feeding Grounds in the Patok Area of Albania, 2008-2010” included the satellite tracking of three loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). Turtles were caught incidentally by local fishermen who find them in their fish traps called “stavnikes”. One turtle (Shpresa) was assumed to be an early-adult female; the other two (Guximtari and Patoku) were immature males (sexually-developing). The project revealed habitat use by these males, different overwintering strategies, the timing of a return migration into Albanian waters, and the fact that all three turtles used Drini Bay in consecutive summers i.e. showing fidelity to a foraging site.The overall project aimed to establish the Patok lagoon area and Drini Bay in general as an important foraging area for sea turtles. Together with data and results derived using ‘traditional’ research methods (tagging, etc), the satellite tracking data have been used to justify the need for sea turtle protection measures to be enacted in Albania. Management Recommendations for Drini Bay and an Action Plan for the Conservation of Sea Turtles and their Habitats in Albania were formally submitted by MEDASSET to the Albanian Authorities in January 2012; the latter was officially adopted by Ministerial Order No. 596 on 22nd November 2012: a contribution to the Mediterranean Region’s endeavours to safeguard turtles in all of their habitats and migratory corridors.Further reading:Project report: http://www.medasset.org/cms/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=196&amp;Itemid=85&amp;lang=en This project has been presented at the 4th Mediterranean Conference of Marine Turtles.

      "This project takes place in Guadeloupe and Saint-Martin, French West Indies, where almost 1,000 turtles die as bycatch each year. Indeed, turtles feeding ground are often fishing area as well, as fishing is mainly coastal there, causing mortality in both nesting and foraging green and hawksbill. Informations are needed to adapt conservation efforts to protect our turtles on their whole home range.“SEATAG” focus on green: we have already settled 4 satellites devices on green nesting females in 2006 and 2007, and 2 satellites tags on feeding individuals in 2010.2013-2014 project include settlement of 7 GPS-tags on feeding green turtles, and 4 tags on nesting females.Deployment started in may, 2013 in Petite-Terre natural Reserve. We have presently 1 tag still running –but not for long- on one feeding juvenile, Cerise (foraging in Petite-Terre natural Reserve, located in the Atlantic Ocean). Lydie’s tags (same feeding ground) stopped few months ago and Robinson’s and Loanne’s (foraging in west coast of Guadeloupe, Caraibean sea) as well in june.In 2014, 4 nesting greens was equiped by tags. Fifine nested in south Basse-Terre, Marion nested in Petite Terre, Léa nested in East Grand-Terre and Yolande nested in north Basse-Terre.After few months these four tags was turned off. In 2015, 2 foraging immature greens was captured in seagrass near Tintamarre Island. A GPS tag was deployedon each turtle : Joe and Sasha. The survey start the 15 june 2015. This would helps to improve knowledge, to enhance conservation measures, on :-\tFeeding and diving  behavior on foraging grounds in guadeloupean waters -\tMigratory pathways of nesting females-\tFeeding grounds of green females which use guadeloupean beaches as nesting sitesOutreach programs are linked with this project. A drawing contest took place at the beginning of 2013, to design SEATAG project logo: winners choose “Robinson’s” name, won a t-shirt and assisted in October at a deployment.\n",

They are constantly impacted by a variety of both natural and anthropogenic factors.Satellite telemetry is a powerful tool for examining short- and long-term movements of these protected species and enhancing conservation and management efforts. These observations will allow us to examine how much time these turtles actually spend in the Mississippi Sound and what microhabitats they utilize. The use of satellite tags on recently rehabilitated and released sea turtles will increase our knowledge about the daily activities and habitat fidelity of these animals.\n",

      "Marine turtles have complex life cycles that include long-distance movements across coastal and pelagic habitats to access juvenile nurseries, foraging grounds, and eventually breeding grounds. Understanding these movement patterns is important for knowing habitat requirements and potential mortality risks for populations on a local, regional, and global scale. This knowledge is critically needed to inform resource managers and adopt best management practices for all populations. Although we are starting to understand the migration patterns for some species, there is a paucity of information regarding movement patterns of sea turtles that utilize nesting grounds in West Africa. We installed satellite tags on four female olive ridley sea turtles near the end of nesting season in Ghana. The purpose of this study was to determine their movement away from the nesting grounds. Two individuals remained in coastal waters within the Gulf of Guinea, whereas two individuals swam southerly and entered pelagic habitats of the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Even with the small sample size, these data suggest individuals disperse to different habitats near the end of nesting season.\n",

      "Reported occurrences of the killer whale (<i>Orcinus orca</i>) off Venezuela are scarce. Eighteen records were opportunistically collected from April 1982 through January 2008. Bottom depth for the sightings was 10-1,500 m (mean = 444 + SD = 405; mode = 400, n = 18). Five records had available associated still photographs or video. Noteworthy was a videotaped attack by two killer whales on a leatherback turtle (<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>). Group size ranged from 1-5 individuals (mean = 2.67 + SD = 1.57; mode = 1,  n = 18). Adult males were present during 67% of reported sightings; females/juveniles were present in 61% (n = 12 and 11, respectively). Pictures of two male killer whales were sent to researchers in Brazil and the Bahamas for comparison purposes. Adult males were present in 92% of reported sightings. Females and juveniles were observed during 67% of reported sightings. 83% of the records were from December through May. There is currently not enough information to speculate on any seasonality to the occurrence of this species in Venezuelan waters.\n",

With more than 1,900 marine mammal encounters in the Bahamas, we are providing the only comprehensive documentation of the marine mammal fauna in this part of the world. Our research is based on the use of systematic boat-based surveys for describing the distribution and habitat use of different marine mammal species. We employ photo-identification techniques for the recognition of individual whales and dolphins, and we have developed new statistical approaches for using these data to determine abundance estimates and occupancy patterns. This photographic sampling is complemented by the collection of skin and faecal samples for molecular genetic analysis, which are being used to assess levels of genetic diversity and investigate the structuring of marine mammal populations.\n",

Lo anterior contribuye al estudio de su comportamiento en el mar, lo cual provee conocimientos invaluables para definir las diferentes rutas migratorias y estimar él o los grupos componentes de la población reproductiva. El uso de telemetría nos ofrece un gran apoyo, para responder a preguntas esenciales para el manejo y la conservación de las tortugas marinas, así como comparar nuestros resultados con otras poblaciones de tortugas en el mundo. \t \tConsiderando la importancia de este tipo de estudios el Gobierno Municipal de Los Cabos, B.C.S. a través de su Programa para Protección de Tortugas Marinas con el apoyo de diversas organizaciones, en el año del 2009 dieron inicio al al proyecto “TRAS LA RUTA DE LAS TORTUGAS GOLFINAS .... !!!”, debido a la poca información con la que se cuenta para esta especie con respecto a sus movimientos y rutas migracionales en Los Cabos, los datos que se obtienen del seguimiento de las tortugas que son estudiadas, podrán servir de base para futuras decisiones en cuanto a conservación y manejo.  \t \tEl 27 de septiembre del 2017 el H. XII Ayuntamiento de Los Cabos con el apoyo de La Organización para la Sustentabilidad y Conservación del Medio Ambiente, AC y del Hotel Hyatt Ziva dan continuidad al proyecto de seguimiento vía satélite liberando en las Playas de San José del Cabo, BCS a una tortuga hembra adulta a la que le fue instalado un transmisor satelital y fue llamada “Ziva”. \t \tAunado al seguimiento El Programa de Protección a la Tortuga Marina del H. XII Ayuntamiento de Los Cabos, BCS con la ayuda de La Organización para la Sutentabilidad y La Conservación del Medio Ambiente, AC dan continuidad a un proyecto educativo en el cual a través del seguimiento satelital de esta tortuga se realizaran actividades que están diseñadas principalmente para los niveles de primaria y bachillerato, y que pueden ser adaptadas para niveles superiores o inferiores. Todas y cada una de las actividades han sido correlacionadas con los programas de estudio de la Secretaría de Educación Pública. Además, muchas son interdisciplinarias e incluyen español, matemáticas, historia, ciencias sociales, así como conocimientos y habilidades científicas. \t \tLas actividades están diseñada para realizarse independientemente, durante el seguimiento de Ziva” a través de internet o simplemente como una experiencia posterior. Cada actividad presenta al inicio una o varias preguntas que promueven la participación de sus alumnos en una lluvia de ideas, para despertar interés en el tema, para fomentar el hábito de la investigación, para permitir que sus alumnos compartan con los demás lo que ya saben, para que hagan más preguntas y juntos busquen las respuestas y disfruten del proceso Enseñanza - Aprendizaje, recordando siempre que el proceso de llegar a una conclusión es tan importante como la conclusión misma. Con esto “Ziva” se convierte en una invaluable tortuga no solo para conocer su biología, sino para ayudarnos a enseñar dentro de las aulas. Siendo este un programa innovador y realmente divertido para los jóvenes.\n",

      "The objective of this current survey effort was to conduct baseline surveys to further document marine mammal and sea turtle occurrence in nearshore waters around the island of Guam. This report presents the results of the Guam Marine Species Monitoring Survey conducted on the MV Island Girl from February 17 to March 3, 2011. This survey covered an area of approximately 4,100 square kilometers (km2)(1,200 square nautical miles ([nm2]) to document marine mammal\n",

The approach primarily followed opportunistic survey protocols used in a recent survey around Guam (Ligon et al. 2011), which remained nearshore (within 5.6 kilometers [km] or 3 nautical miles [nm] of the coastline). ). The resulting sightings, therefore, consisted of spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris; 7 of 9 sightings) and a mixed group of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus). In addition, one species of sea turtle was observed (green\n",

      "Historical records indicate that green, olive ridley, hawksbill, and loggerhead sea turtles once utilized Ghana’s coastal waters as foraging grounds.  Records also indicate leatherback, green, olive ridley, hawksbill, and loggerhead also utilized Ghana’s shore as nesting habitat.  There has not been a confirmed loggerhead or hawksbill nest in Ghana for 25 years indicating these two species have most likely been extirpated from the region.  Currently, the leatherback, olive ridley, and green sea turtles are the only remaining species nesting in Ghana. Sea turtles in this region are exposed to a maze of fishing vessels and nets that must be carefully avoided to reach the nesting beach.  Each year large sea turtle stranding events are documented during time periods of off-shore and near-shore fishing.  Illegal commercial fishing activity occurs regularly in shallow off-shore waters, whereas commercial and subsidence fishing take place near-shore and off the beach.  Understanding the temporal and spatial movement patterns of olive ridleys would provide information on the interaction of sea turtles and fisheries in Ghana's waters.With funding from the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund, we are gathering knowledge and creating educational programs necessary to implementing a conservation program that is socially and economically self-sustaining over the long term.  The proposed research will answer key questions about the ecology of olive ridley sea turtles that will allow limited existing resources to be used most effectively into the future, and will incorporate educational programs to reverse the social perception of sea turtles so that their preservation is part of the cultural norm.\n",

      "Cayman Turtle Farm: Island Wildlife Encounter in West Bay, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands is the first commercial sea turtle farm in the world to have achieved the 2nd generation of Green Sea turtles bred, laid, hatched and raised in captivity.  Visitors are welcomed to the site which has been developed into a mini theme park attraction featuring island wildlife in addition to turtles of all ages, for example indigenous and Caribbean birds in a free-flight aviary, a large salt-water crocodile, sharks and other marine predators, iguanas, and a nature trail full of various other flora and fauna.Cayman Turtle Farm also participates in leading research on the biology and care of sea turtles.  In 1984 Cayman Turtle Farm participated in an international project to help conserve Kemp's Ridley sea turtles, and the farm achieved the first successful captive breeding of the species for later release in that species' native territory to help boost the wild population.  CTF's stock of Green Sea turtles of a wide range of known ages from hatchlings to over 40 years old, and the CTF experts' experience in the husbandry of these exotic animals, have created unique opportunities for learning more about these magnificent creatures.  Some 100 scientific papers have been published or presented based on research in which Cayman Turtle Farm was involved.  The release of satellite-tagged 2nd-generation captive-bred turtles will help expand knowledge of the adaptation and behaviour of captive-bred turtles released into the wild.More information about Cayman Turtle Farm and its programmes is available at www.turtle.ky\n",

      "En el Golfo de California se encuentran 5 de las 7 especies de tortugas marinas que existen en el mundo, todas consideradas en riesgo de extinción. Sólo tres especies de tortugas marinas (golfina, negra y laúd) llegan anidar a las playas de la península de Baja California. La tortuga golfina es la especie con mayor abundancia de nidos.Con el apoyo de la Alianza WWF-Telcel se ha permitido consolidar los programas de conservación de tortugas marinas en el estado de Baja California Sur a través de la investigación y actividades de rastreo satelital, educación ambiental, capacitación de expertos, protección de sitios de anidación y el fortalecimiento de un Centro de Protección e Investigación de la Tortuga Marina, del Municipio de Los Cabos. “Gracias al trabajo conjunto de la Alianza, el gobierno local, la Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (CONANP), grupos tortugueros y el sector hotelero el Programa para la Protección de Tortugas Marinas desarrolló el proyecto ‘tras la ruta de la tortuga golfina’, que ha logrado el seguimiento satelital de ocho tortugas marinas -Renata, Abby, Esperanza, Marisol, Terramar, Camila, Raquel y Azteca-”, explicó Graciela Tiburcio,asesora de la Dirección municipal de educación, divulgación y difusión ambiental del Gobierno de Los Cabos. La Alianza ha participado también en el marcaje satelital de cuatro tortugas prietas y dos tortugas carey con otras asociaciones. Los datos obtenidos por 5 años proveen información sobre lugares de estancia, distancias y posibles rutas migratorias. Ello contribuye a estimar los grupos de la población reproductiva, compararlos con otras poblaciones del mundo y tomar decisiones sobre su manejo y conservación. Por ejemplo, demostró que, contrario a lo que se creía, las tortugas golfinas no se alejan del territorio mexicano y, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de alimento, pueden incluso permanecer frente a las costas realizando movimientos entre Sinaloa, Jalisco y Nayarit. “El seguimiento satelital es una herramienta invaluable de educación ambiental. Con base en él, se diseñó un proyecto para escuelas primarias con actividades vinculadas a español, matemáticas, historia y ciencias sociales y habilidades científicas, correlacionadas con los programas de estudio de la Secretaría de Educación Pública, en el que se rastrea a las tortugas por internet o mediante una experiencia posterior. Con ello se sensibilizó a los alumnos sobre el valor natural de su entorno, se promovió la protección de las tortugas y se contribuyó a la formación de personas que habrán de manejar los recursos costeros responsablemente”.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The Kemp's ridley sea turtle <i>Lepidochelys kempii</i> is recovering from declines that reduced nesting from a single-day estimate of 10000 to 40000 females in 1947 to &lt;300 during the entire 1985 nesting season. Although beach monitoring is crucial to estimating nesting population size and activity, in-water data are essential for understanding population dynamics, evaluating management strategies, and ensuring the species’ continued recovery. Fifteen immature and 7 adult female ridleys were fitted with platform terminal transmitters and released off the upper Texas coast during 2004 through 2007. Immature individuals were tracked primarily during warmer months and exhibited preferences for tidal passes, bays, coastal lakes, and nearshore waters, although movement patterns varied among years. Females tracked during their inter-­nesting intervals remained in the vicinity of the upper Texas coast and, upon entering the post-nesting stage, moved eastward along the 20 m isobath to foraging areas offshore of central Louisiana. Satellite telemetry indicated that inshore and continental shelf waters of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico serve as developmental, migratory, inter-nesting, and post-nesting habitat for the Kemp’s ridley. Projected population growth will likely lead to increased use of the northwestern Gulf by the species and more frequent encounters with human activities. The extent of such anthropogenic interactions and need for mitigation measures should be examined and considered by natural resource managers to facilitate continued recovery of this and other sea turtle species in the Gulf of Mexico. Likewise, research efforts should be continued to better understand seasonal in-water distributions, abundances, population dynamics, and mortality risks to all life history stages.\n",

      "From 4 to 13 August 1991, as part of a larger study, Alaska harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) abundance was investigated during an aerial survey throughout the coastal waters of Bristol Bay. A Twin Otter was used as the survey platform and was flown at an altitude of 152.2 m (500 ft) and at an airspeed of 185 km/h. The third of three identical sawtooth track lines was flown along the south side of Bristol Bay. Line-transect methodology was used, and only those observations made during optimal conditions were analyzed. Density of harbor porpoises was calculated using line transect estimates based on perpendicular distances of sightings to the cruise track of the airplane. On average, porpoise group size and density for Bristol Bay was 1.17 (SE = 0.35) and 4.48 groups/100 km2 (SE = 1.38).\n",

      "A multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional pilot expedition was organized by the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research (NCAOR) to the ice-free areas of the Western Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean onboard ORV Sagar Kanya during the austral summer of 2004 (January-March). This survey, conducted by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), is the first Indian attempt to survey for cetacean diversity in the Southern Ocean. The ultimate objective is to determine distribution, relative abundance, migration patterns and critical habitat parameters. 68% of a total of 13 sightings (22 individuals) were positively identified and species observed included Antarctic minke whales (<i>Balaenoptera bonaerensis</i>), fin whales (<i>B. physalus</i>), sei whales (<i>B. borealis</i>) and blue whales (<i>B. musculus</i>). The blue whales were not identified to the sub-species level. The highest concentration of cetaceans was between 35° and 37°S (along 45°E) and between 48° and 53°S (along 45°E). Relatively small numbers of cetaceans were observed during the present cruise, possibly because most of the cetacean sighting effort was made during inclement sea conditions. Results on the sighting characteristics and occurrence patterns of the cetaceans in relation to the region and hydrographical parameters are discussed briefly <i>vis a vis</i> published information from the Southern Ocean.\n",

One of the aspects that is especially relevant to the newly protected rookery of Bangkaru is to know what the entire range of movement is of its nesting turtles. Through satellite tagging Yayasan Pulau Banyak is able to have more insight in the post-nesting migrations and feeding grounds. On June 15 and June 17 2010, the first two sea turtles in Sumatra, have been fitted with a satellite transmitter to track their movements.

In 1988 a preliminary field study was carried out by Brian Groombridge and Claire Whitmore and SPOT later made further surveys of the North Cyprus coast and found numbers of nesting green and loggerhead turtles sufficient to merit further investigation. In the early 1990s SPOT contacted Glasgow University and in 1992 the first pioneering team of students were sent to make a thorough survey. On the basis of this expedition, Kutlay agreed to provide accommodation on his land at Alagadi, and this became the Alagadi Goat Shed and Sleeping House, which twenty years on are still used by the Marine Turtle Conservation Project (MTCP) as the hub of research and conservation of turtles in North Cyprus.

      "To document the Grenadian marine mammal fauna and its distribution in the eastern Caribbean, we conducted field and archival studies in that country. All records of sirenians and cetaceans for Grenada were assembled and analyzed. The total number of confirmed marine mammal species for this part of the world is 11. The humpback whale (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>) was the most commonly reported mysticete species while a variety of odontocetes seem to be equally frequent in those waters. The manatee (<i>Trichechus manatus</i>) has been extinct from those waters for at least 300 years. Comparison with the marine mammal fauna of adjacent regions (Venezuela, Trinidad, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines), leads us to believe that at least seven additional species of cetaceans may be present in Grenadian waters, probably as occasional visitors.\n",

Pocos nidos son registrados cada año (4 a 15 nidos) pero tortugas Carey Juvenil son reportadas continuamente por pescadores y buzos. Carey adultos son reportadas ocasionalmente.Nuestro proyecto pretende incrementar la conciencia y comprensión de estas tortugas en peligro crítico a través del rastreo satelital. Este rastreo o seguimiento nos ayudara a identificar sitios de alimentación claves y zonas de movimientos de las tortugas Carey. Esperamos que al facilitar que los habitantes de las comunidades locales asistan a las liberaciones de tortugas Carey con rastreadores satelitales crearemos futuros conservacionistas para beneficio de las Carey y otras tortugas marinas en nuestra área.English:East Pacific hawksbill turtles are considered one of the most endangered sea turtle populations in the world.Principal nesting sites have been identified in El Salvador and Nicaragua with sporadic nesting in other areas including Mexico. It is estimated that between all known nesting sites only 450 to 500 nests are laid each year.In the Mexican Pacific the main areas for hawksbill nesting are Nayarit and Jalisco states, which mark the northern nesting limit for the East Pacific hawksbill population. Few nests are registered each year (4-15 nests) however juvenile hawksbills are often reported by fishers and divers. Adult hawksbills are also occasionally reported.Our project aims to increase understanding and awareness of these critically endangered turtles via tracking. Tracking will help us identify key foraging habitat and ranges for hawksbill turtles. We hope that by allowing local communities to attend the releases of tagged turtles we will create future conservation advocates for hawksbills and other sea turtles in our region.\n",

      "On 1 and 2 August 1991, as part of a larger study, Alaska harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) abundance was investigated during an aerial survey throughout the coastal waters of Cook Inlet. A Twin Otter was used to fly a single sawtooth trackline across Cook Inlet at an altitude of 152.2 m (500 ft) and at an airspeed of 185 km/h. Line-transect methodology was used, and only those observations made during optimal conditions were analyzed. Density of harbor porpoises was calculated using line transect estimates based on perpendicular distances of sightings to the cruise track of the airplane. On average, porpoise group size and density for Cook Inlet was 1.33 (SE = 0.33) and 0.54 groups/100 km2 (SE = 0.31).\n",

      "Purpose:\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Razorbills (Alca torda) are a stalky, crow-sized seabird which reside in arctic and subarctic marine waters from Maine to Northern Russia.  As a member of the Auk family they are closely related to puffins, guillemots and murres.  Razorbills prefer the open ocean, only coming ashore during the breeding season to lay one egg in a rock burrow or crevice. The male razorbill will escort the chick to sea 18-20 days after it hatches, remaining together for up to two months. Razorbills feed primarily on herring and hake and may dive more than 100 meters to catch these prey items. Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge and its partners have worked for the past 30 years to manage and restore seabird colonies along the coast of Maine. The Refuge currently supports 90% of the Atlantic puffins and 85% of the razorbills breeding in the United States. While we have extensive data on size, species composition, and distribution of breeding colonies, very little data has been collected regarding the movements away from the colony. The small number of breeding colonies and the limited geographic distribution of the managed colonies increases the need to maintain suitable foraging habitat within commuting range of the breeding colonies. Adult razorbills must find enough food to feed themselves and their growing chick. The location of foraging habitat is highly dynamic, and may vary depending on water temperature, current, or forage fish availability. The Gulf of Maine supports a tremendous diversity of pelagic seabirds that rely on these cold, productive waters during a portion of their annual life cycle. For species such as Atlantic puffin and razorbills, the Gulf of Maine represents the southern limit of their breeding distribution in the United States. As with any species at the fringe of their distribution, these birds are likely to be highly sensitive to changes in habitat and prey availability resulting from global climate change. Managers are concerned that increasing sea surface temperatures, changes in commercial harvest rates of key forage species, and potential offshore energy development could now threaten the ability of this region to support pelagic seabirds.During the winter of 2012-2013, razorbills were documented hundreds of kilometers south of their normal range. In addition, hundreds of dead razorbills, puffins and murres washed ashore on beaches from Florida to Maine.  The reasons for these mortality events and range shift are unknown. The data provided by this satellite tagging effort will provide the first insights into the daily and seasonal movement patterns of this species of conservation concern.Objectives: 1) Document foraging behavior and the location of foraging habitat for chick-rearing razorbills2.) Document movement patterns of parent/chick pairs following departure from the breeding colony 3) Determine migration pathways, habitat use, and wintering areas for razorbills in the North Atlantic4) Document characteristics of marine habitat occupied by razorbills, and predict how environmental change (i.e. climate change or offshore development) may influence the availability of these habitats This information will play a critical role in the evaluation of offshore energy development for both conservation agencies and potential developers. While the conservation community is clearly supportive of green energy, we believe it is imperative that wildlife conservation must be considered during the planning and development of these projects. This research will help us guide the energy development into regions of the coast that are less likely to support large concentrations of pelagic seabirds. Four razorbills in this study were named for lighthouse keepers and US Coast Guard staff formerly stationed on Matinicus Rock (location where we tagged the birds). The fifth bird (Anthony) is named for our favorite soldier, who is overseas serving his country. For more information please contact: Linda_Welch@fws.gov\n",

      "This juvenile male harbor porpoise known as “Oscar,” stranded on Skaket Beach in Orleans, Massachusetts, on February 17, 2008.  He was rescued by the Cape Cod Stranding Network, A Project of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, and transported to the New England Aquarium for rehabilitation.  Oscar was weak and thin, weighing only 20 kilograms upon arrival, and had a 5cm laceration on his left tail stock.  Diagnostic testing revealed small numbers of intestinal parasites and a mild infection. Oscar was treated with antibiotics and anti-parasite drugs.  Shortly after admitting him to our animal hospital, he developed a cough and moderate to severe dermatitis (a skin infection).  Treatment continued with antibiotic and antifungal medications, until the infection gradually resolved.  Oscar gained 7 kilograms and a great deal of strength during his treatment.  He was released on May 21, 2008 in Massachusetts Bay.The New England Aquarium (NEAq) is a non-profit organization that responds to stranded whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals and sea turtles.  NEAq maintains a rehabilitation hospital for sick or injured marine mammals and sea turtles. Our mission is to provide rapid response and humane care to stranded marine mammals and sea turtles, to conduct research and education and to promote conservation.\n",

      "Lagniappe is an adult female Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtle that was found in a burrow pit pond in Southern Vermilion Parish, Louisiana and is believed to have been trapped in the pond since Hurricane Ike in September 2008.  The term “Lagniappe” means “an extra or unexpected gift or benefit” and is a term commonly used in Louisiana. The rescue effort for Lagniappe was spearheaded by The Louisiana Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Rescue Program-“ LMMSTRP” along with the valuable help of other partner organizations such as The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) and the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas (AAOA).  The rescue took place on March 11, 2009.  Once the turtle was rescued it was transported to the Audubon’s Aquatic Center (AAC).  LDWF furthermore secured LMMSTRP the funding to obtain a satellite tag.  Lagniappe was outfitted with a Kiwistat 101 tag by Sirtrack.  The tracking of a rehabilitated sea turtle is very important to the LMMSTRP program in that a rehab turtle has not been tagged since 2005.  Lagniappe was released on October 14, 2009 21 miles off the coast of Grand Isle, Louisiana.  Along the Louisiana Coast we get countless stranded sea turtles in particular Kemp’s Ridley.  By tagging Lagniappe we hope to gain more crucially valuable data that would enable us to understand more about such an endangered species.The Louisiana Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Rescue Program is a volunteer organization based out of Audubon Aquarium of the Americas through the Audubon Nature Institute. It is committed to the humane care and treatment of injured, ill, or out-of-habit marine mammals (such as manatees) and sea turtles.\n",

Therefore, here we describe a new species of Balaenoptera, which is characterized by its unique cranial morphology, its small number of baleen plates, and by its distant molecular relationships with all of its congeners.

      "Satellite-monitored radio tags have yielded important information for the conservation and management of large whales.  Tags provide far greater detail on large whale movements and habitat use than more traditional studies, and past tagging projects have revealed the existence of entirely unknown whale habitats.  However, it is not uncommon for tags to stop transmitting within days to months of deployment, and follow-up studies on the individuals have been limited. Further work is needed to improve the scientific and conservation value of this technology.In this study, satellite tagging and its effects are being examined among Gulf of Maine humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). This is among the best studied humpback whale populations.  Its strong fidelity to particular feeding sites, long feeding ground residency and strong overlap with observer effort that are expected to result in repeated sightings of tagged animals, and a maximized resighting potential in future years.  The project will also produce new information on humpback whale movement and habitat use in relation to the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.\n",

Understanding this complex conflict requires data on spatial and dietary overlap of marine mammal and fisheries. In Uruguay, the South American sea lions population has been dramatically declining over the past decade. The reasons for this population decline are unknown but may include the following: (1) direct harvesting; (2) reduced prey availability and distribution as a consequence of environmental change; or (3) biological interaction with fisheries. This study aims to determine resource overlap and competition between South American sea lions (SASL, <i>Otaria flavescens</i>, n=10) and the artisanal fisheries (AF), and the coastal bottom trawl fisheries (CBTF).\n",

Reservations are recommended as space is limited please call (305) 743-2552The Turtle Hospital was opened in 1986 with four main goals: 1) rehab injured sea turtles and return them to the wild, 2) educate the public through outreach programs to local schools, 3) conduct and assist with research which aids the sea turtles (in conjunction with state universities), and 4) work toward environmental legislation which makes the beaches and water safe and clean for sea turtles.The Turtle Hospital (Hidden Harbor Marine Environmental Project, Inc.) is a 501(c)(3) charitable corporation. The Hidden Harbor Motel provides the space and buildings needed to house and care for the sea turtles. The Turtle Hospital offers Guided Educational Experiences to public daily 7 days a week. Please call 305-743-2552 for further information and reservations.The Turtle Hospital contains up-to-date equipment needed to perform a variety of surgeries on different species and sizes of sea turtles. More than half of this equipment has been donated by local hospitals and doctors, and some equipment has been donated by environmentally- friendly organizations and individuals.RehabilitationA variety of turtle ailments are treated here, including flipper amputations caused by fishing line and trap rope entanglements, shell damage caused by boat collisions, and intestinal impactions caused by ingestion of foreign materials such as plastic bags, balloons, and fishing line and/or hooks. The most common surgery performed is the removal of debilitating viral tumors that affect over 50% of the sea turtles in the Keys and around the world.ResearchThe Turtle Hospital and the University of Florida have been doing cooperative research into the causes of fibropapilloma, the devastating viral tumors which affect sea turtles. This is currently the only known disease affecting wild animals on a global basis. The virus has been successfully transmitted (proving that it is infectious) and current research concentrates on isolating the cause.ReleaseThe Turtle Hospital has successfully treated and released over 1000 Sea Turtles since its founding in 1986. The turtles are released in a variety of ways and at different locations depending on species. Greens are taken either to Pigeon Key via ambulance or they are taken to a spot 20 miles north of Marathon in the Florida Bay. Loggerheads are usually released at Pigeon Key or launched off a boat into the gulf or ocean. Kemp’s Ridleys are taken 70 miles west of Key West out to the coral reefs of the Dry Tortugas.\n",

      "The beaches along the coast of South-West Sumbawa, historically had been known as significant nesting sites for at least three species of marine turtles, namely the Green turtle, Hawksbill, and the Olive Ridley turtle. Despite of the beauty and the intactness of the coastal areas, all species of turtle populations have undergone a dramatic decline due to massive eggs collection for local consumption. In the past, this area was also one of the traditional catching sites for turtle hunters who eventually sold them for Bali market. This post-nesting turtle migration study is conducted by WWF Indonesia and WWF Denmark in collaboration with the Regional Nature Conservation Agency of West Nusa Tenggara and PT NNT (a mining company operates in this area), to raise awareness among the local community, local government, as well as private sectors in the area. The awareness is not only necessary to reverse the declining trend of turtle population, but also to turtleï¿½s resilience to the effects of climate change and give them the best possible chance of survival into the future by means of encouraging the locals to protect their known nesting and foraging habitats.This project is part of a larger program build within the Coral Triangle Region to determine the migration routes of turtle population that is vital for establishing a network of turtle protected area.\n",

      "HistoryThe Vancouver Aquarium has been involved in the rescue and rehabilitation of marine mammals for over forty years. In that time, the Marine Mammal Rescue centre has grown from admitting one or two animals in a season, to admitting nearly 100 in some years.The program currently admits over 100 distressed marine mammals per year. Each of these animals requires our expert veterinary treatment and supportive care to recuperate before they are released back into the ocean.The Marine Mammal Rescue centre is run without governmental operational support.Species and RangeThe program is available to assist distressed marine mammals from the length of the British Columbia coastline.Elephant seals, sea otters, Steller sea lions, harbour porpoises, sea turtles, common dolphins, and killer whales have all been the subjects of our efforts, but neonate (newborn) harbour seals are the most commonly admitted patients to the Marine Mammal Rescue centre.The current facilities of the Marine Mammal centre allow for on-site rehabilitation of seals, sea lions, sea otters, and small cetaceans such as harbour porpoises. The rescue of larger marine mammals would involve the use of ocean pens or other secondary facilities.GoalsThe primary goal of the Marine Mammal Rescue Centre is to provide housing and care for ill, injured, or abandoned marine mammals and to rehabilitate them for release back into their natural habitat.Additional program goals include:Establishing written protocols for the rehabilitation of different marine mammal species in order to serve as a resource in the event of natural or man-made disasters that impact upon marine mammals.  Monitoring the status of wild populations through the scientific study of ill or orphaned marine mammals treated by the AquariumPerforming a public service to offer assistance to marine mammals that may be in peril due to habitat destruction and environmental damage caused by humansEducating the public on how to properly respond to apparently stranded or diseased marine mammals\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "A male Steller sea lion was brought to the Vancouver Aquraium’s Marine Mammal Rescue Centre (MMR) on December 18, 2010. He was found the day prior, wandering around a trailer park in Port Alice, BC over 300 metres away from the ocean. Concerned citizens of the trailer park called Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and Officer Greg Plummer came to assess the situation. The rescue centre was then called and pictures of the animal were sent to allow the staff to be able to evaluate the sea lion. It was noted by staff veterinarian Dr. Haulena that the animal looked underweight and dehydrated, and because of the unusual behavior of the animal, he felt that the sea lion should be brought into the rescue centre for more of an evaluation. Arrangements were made with DFO to collect and house the animal over night, so he could be on the first plane to Vancouver in the am via Pacific Coast Airlines.Once at the centre, “Kaouk” (as named by Greg Plummer) settled in nicely and was examined by staff. Despite being underweight and dehydrated, he seemed in fairly decent condition and was started on a diet of herring, which was slowly increased over time.  As his herring amounts increased, so did his activity level and subsequently his waist line did as well. He ate very well from his first meal to his last at MMR, over doubling his weight from 50 kg, to over 110 kg! Once at a releasable weight and health, it was decided by DFO and Aquarium staff that he was happy and healthy enough to return to the wild. On March 17, 2011 he did just that and was released off the West Coast of Vancouver Island at Toquart Bary in Barkley Sound. Before he was released, Kaouk was outfitted with a satellite tag to be able to monitor his whereabouts. This site was established so you too can monitor his daily activity. Kaouk is the first Steller sea lion to be released from MMR and the first animal to be released from MMR outfitted with a satellite tracker. A big Thank you to Fisheries and Oceans Canada for your support and supplying the satellite and VHF tracking system for Kaouk.\n",

      "The captive sea turtles on the United States Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Test Site (RTS) have been part of island life for almost as long as the test site has existed there (approximately 40 years). Starting off as a concrete lined ditch and then undergoing a renovation in 1995, the turtle pond is home to six green sea turtles (3 females and 3 males) and one male Hawksbill. Oversight of the pond is performed by Kwajalein Range Services (KRS), the current M&amp;O contractor. It became necessary to release several males in order to balance the number of male turtles to female turtles. Additionally, release of the Hawksbill was imperative to prevent the possible intermingling of turtle species. One mature female green and the mature male hawksbill were fitted with satellite transmitters and released on April 20, 2006. The release and tracking will provide much needed data on Marshall Island turtles including, nesting, feeding and migration patterns. Two other green sea turtles were also released but did not have transmitters attached.\n",

      "Satellite-monitored radio tags have yielded important information for the conservation and management of large whales. Tags provide far greater detail on large whale movements and habitat use than more traditional studies, and past tagging projects have revealed the existence of entirely unknown whale habitats. However, it is not uncommon for tags to stop transmitting within days to months of deployment, and follow-up studies on the individuals have been limited. Further work is needed to improve the scientific and conservation value of this technology. In this study, satellite tagging and its effects are being examined among Gulf of Maine humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). This is among the best studied humpback whale populations. Its strong fidelity to particular feeding sites, long feeding ground residency and strong overlap with observer effort that are expected to result in repeated sightings of tagged animals, and a maximized resighting potential in future years. The project will also produce new information on humpback whale movement and habitat use in relation to the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.\n",

A core understanding of the population dynamics and seasonal distributions of these animals is essential in assessing steps to recovery of listed marine turtle species.  Yet little is known about the early life stage migratory patterns of these turtles and their usage of the estuarine and nearshore habitats of Northeast Florida.  One of these species is the Atlantic Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas) , which is listed as an endangered species in the State of Florida.\n",

      "Turtles are an important component of the ecosystem, and may serve as a key biological indicator of the health of their environments. They are constantly impacted by a variety of both natural and anthropogenic factors.Satellite telemetry is a powerful tool for examining short- and long-term movements of these protected species and enhancing conservation and management efforts. These observations will allow us to examine how much time these turtles actually spend in the Mississippi Sound and what microhabitats they utilize. The use of satellite tags on recently rehabilitated and released sea turtles will increase our knowledge about the daily activities and habitat fidelity of these animals.\n",

      "In response to population declines noted for many sharks and other elasmobranch species around the world, protecting them from overexploitation has become a global priority. However, the necessary data to assess the diversity and abundance of elasmobranchs has often hindered efforts to effectively restore and protect such species. Many reef surveys around the world have been conducted by scuba divers, although many studies have exposed the flaws and biases of this type of surveys for species such as elasmobranchs. Sampling of these species has traditionally been  resource and time intensive due to the need to capture sharks or rays on lines. Recently, advances in video technology have allowed the deployment BRUVs. This technique involves positioning a bait source in front of an underwater video camera and quantifying the fish that are observed in the field of view over a standard sampling period and are an ideal way to quickly, and inexpensively, sample populations of relatively low-density predators like sharks and rays. Due to the remote location of Isla Cayo Serranilla, in the northernmost region of the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve, there is a lack of knowledge of elasmobranch species and their abundance in the area. In order to estimate reef elasmobranch diversity and relative abundance in the Colombian Caribbean at Isla Cayo Serranilla and detect possible bright spots in the region, 52 BRUVs were deployed on the fore-reef and the inner lagoon. Depth was standardized between 8 and 30 m and deployments were performed using standardized pre-weighted bait. Videos will be watched, and species and the maximum number of reef species observed in a single frame (Nmax) will be recorded. This estimate (Nmax) is similar to the Catch per Unit of Effort (CPUE) and will be used to assess the relative abundance of reef shark at Isla Cayo Serranilla.\n",
      "Conduct a 2-week Baited Remote Underwater Video Survey (BRUV) of reef elasmobranch diversity and relative abundance in the Colombian Caribbean at Isla Cayo Serranilla (San Andrés Archipelago) and detect possible bright spots in the region. These key baseline data will support future studies on elasmobranchs in other areas of the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve and fill in gaps on the status of elasmobranch populations in the region. This will be combined with large existing BRUV datasets collected in other key locations around the world for a global analysis through the Global FinPrint project (www.globalfinprint.org).\n",

      "GPS loggers and time-depth recorders were used to characterize the foraging behavior of the sexually dimorphic Peruvian booby Sula variegata on 2 islands in northern Peru. We evaluated whether (1) its foraging behavior differed from tropical boobies and temperate gannets (the Peruvian boobies feed in areas of enhanced productivity and high fish density), and (2) females and males exploited different foraging habitats as a consequence of size dimorphism. Birds foraged only during daylight hours, 1 to 3 times a day, in trips of short duration (median = 1.8 h). Overall, 92% of the total foraging time was spent flying. They fed exclusively on anchovetas Engraulis ringens, which were captured in shallow dives (median = 2.5 m, max = 8.8 m) with a dive median rate of 11 dives h–1 (max = 37 dives h–1). The median foraging range was 25 km (max = 68 km), whereas the median total distance traveled was 69 km (max = 179 km). Foraging site fidelity was high, and the orientation of foraging flights in any given day was similar among birds that departed at the same time. There were no sex-specific differences in 13 of 15 foraging variables; however, females dived slightly deeper and spent a larger proportion of time sitting on the water. We speculate that (1) the foraging behavior of Peruvian boobies contrasts with that of their tropical and temperate relatives as a result of the proximity and predictability of food sources, elevated energetic demands of the brood (up to 4 chicks) and\n",
      "high prey encounter rate in the Peruvian upwelling system, and (2) the lack of spatial segregation between sexes may be related to the attraction of birds to feeding aggregations that are formed in the vicinity of the colonies. Once the foraging patches are localized, females dive deeper because of passive mechanisms associated with a heavier mass.\n",

It is a compilation of data from 9 research voyages (SO 05/80, SO 07/80, SO 02/81, SS 03/90, SS 05/91, SS 01/93, SS 02/97, SS 08/97and SS 03/98). The catch of each species in a sample is recorded as raw weight and count, gross weight and count (raw values divided by the subsampling fraction) and per area weight and count. Species are recorded as CAAB codes. Sample attributes include the voyage, location, time, sampling gear and sampled area. The dataset was created for the Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEW) for use in profiling of the North Marine Region during the development of a marine bioregional plan for the region. Data from all voyages are in a single set of tables and in the same structure and measurement units. The aim of the dataset is to provide convenient access to the data from the source datasets, which were stored in various data structures in various locations. Although the data are presented in uniform measurement units of counts and weights per unit area, data from different samples cannot be assumed to be comparable. In particular, the catchability of a species varies among types of sampling gears. Even samples from a given gear type on a given voyage may not all be comparable to one another. For example, gear may be altered during a voyage (e.g. multiple codend mesh sizes may be tried) and fish trawls are occasionally aimed at fish visible on the echo sounder. The data should therefore be analysed no more than semi-quantitatively. Assumptions on the comparability of samples -- even from a single voyage and gear type -- should be based on reference to the voyage reports.\n",

A Twin Otter was used  to fly a single sawtooth trackline at an altitude of 152.2 m (500 ft) and at an airspeed of 185 km/h. Line-transect methodology was used, and only those observations made during optimal conditions were analyzed. Density of harbor porpoises was calculated using line transect estimates based on perpendicular distances of sightings to the cruise track of the airplane.\n",

      "Purpose:\n",
      "Although harbor porpoises, <i>Phocoena phocoena</i>, are known to occur throughout Alaska waters, few estimates of abundance exist. In 1991, the National Marine Mammal Laboratory initiated a 3 year study on Alaska harbor porpoises. The objectives of this program were to: \n",
      "1) Obtain minimum population estimates in coastal waters using line transect methodology with a coefficient of variation for density estimates of less than 30% for each survey area, and \n",
      "2) Establish a baseline for detecting changes in abundance through time, for analysis of trends. \n",
      "During the present study, it was not fiscally possible to survey all areas of the state in any one year.

      "Abstract:\n",
      "A study was carried out from June to September to assess habitat quality for manatees (<i>Trichechus manatus manatus</i>) in the Coswine swamps in French Guiana.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Coswine swamps are one of the largest wetlands in French Guiana and totally under the influence of the tides. The climate is typical for the tropics and has a huge impact on the water regime. In the area, three different protection zones exist. The swamps are quite untouched from humans, perhaps a reason for the high number of manatee sightings in the recent past and its suspected large population size.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the manatee is an aquatic herbivore, in a first part the submerged aquatic vegetation was investigated. At the same time, some variables important for manatee distribution were measured, which had been determined by literature survey. The whole area was divided into sections in which the vegetation and water parameters were recorded during a preliminary study. The results showed, that no submerged aquatic vegetation was present in the Coswine swamps. The aquatic parameters were similar to those obtained in other studies in French Guiana and South America if climatic circumstances are taken into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second part of the study deals with the bank vegetation, as it is supposed, that this is the only available food resource for manatees in the area. The methodological approach was slightly altered for the assessment of the water quality, considering the recommendations made after the first study. The vegetation was sampled in 100 m long transects at the banks with a distance of 1,500 m between each in the whole study area.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the study rarely any manatee was spotted, but this more likely was due to the methods applied than an indicator for the non-presence of sirenians. The aquatic parameters varied slightly more than in the first part of the study. Salinity unexpectedly was low and more than ¾ of all samples were taken in fresh water. The vegetation sampling showed an overwhelming importance of Red Mangrove (<i>Rhizophora racemosa</i>) in the whole study area. In contrast to the first impression on the\n",
      "site, the swamps are quite homogenous when regarding only the aquatic parameters. It is therefore difficult to distinguish any zones of changing environmental aspects. Regarding the vegetation, the Coswine swamps are also homogenous but to a lesser degree as the plants are more influenced by the\n",
      "soil on which they thrive than by the water quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "For manatees, the Coswine swamps seems to provide a suitable habitat with plenty of food in the form of overhanging branches and leaves of Red Mangrove, some mouko-mouko (<i>Montrichardia\n",
      "arborescens</i>) and other consumable plants. The aquatic variables are in a range which is described in literature as manatee-fitting. The quite untouched Coswine swamps provide shelter from waves, humans and pollution. Therefore, they can be judged to be important manatee areas. Corresponding steps for the conservation of this still natural area should be taken and secured by nature protection laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "The aim of the study is the analysis and the description of the important variables determining manatee habitat use in a typical estuarine environment in the Wider Caribbean Region.\n",
      "Precisely, the main questions of the study are:\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>What are the critical factors and in which amplitude do they occur?</li>\n",
      "<li>Are there any remarkable differences regarding the critical factors between distinguishable zones in the study area?</li>\n",
      "<li>How can the zones be classified into groups of similar character?</li>\n",
      "<li>Can any specific behavior of manatees be related to these areas?</li>\n",
      "<li>Is there a difference between already described habitats and the habitat in the Coswine swamps?</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "Therefore, the different variables were measured at stations distributed over the working area in a certain distance. At each station the critical factors of manatee habitat use which were identified during literature study are recorded. Then, in a second step, the stations will be grouped into zones of\n",
      "similar character by means of the vegetation and the aquatic factors. Finally the classified zones are mapped and described.\n",
      "With such a classification and description of an existing area used by manatees, the author aims to contribute to a better knowledge of manatee habitats as it is demanded by Marsh et al. (1986:180), because “the major threat to sirenians is alteration of their habitat.” Powell et al. (1981:645) conclude for the population in Puerto Rico, which is similar to that in French Guiana – small and wide spread- that “destruction of their habitats or human-caused mortality (…) could have a deleterious impact on their status,” because demographic factors, environmental variability and genetic variations can easily influence long-term survival (Reynolds 1999).\n",
      "The results of this study may be used to identify potential manatee habitats with the aid of only a few important variables. This should result in a better adaptation of conservation plans to the specific needs of manatees in a certain area. In addition, monitoring can be focused on the main factors and therefore can be less expensive and easier to handle. Moreover, effects of habitat alteration are easier\n",
      "to predict and adequate countermeasures can be taken. All these improvements should enable nature conservation authorities to respond more quickly to any threats of habitat alteration. In consequence, conservation measures will be easier to apply and will be more efficient. \n",

      "GPS loggers and time-depth recorders were used to haracterize the foraging behavior of the sexually dimorphic Peruvian booby Sula variegata on 2 islands in northern Peru. We evaluated whether (1) its foraging behavior differed from tropical boobies and temperate gannets (the Peruvian boobies feed in areas of enhanced productivity and high fish density), and (2) females and males exploited different foraging habitats as a consequence of size dimorphism. Birds foraged only during daylight hours, 1 to 3 times a day, in trips of short duration (median = 1.8 h). Overall, 92% of the total foraging time was spent flying. They fed exclusively on anchovetas Engraulis ringens, which were captured in shallow dives (median = 2.5 m, max = 8.8 m) with a dive median rate of 11 dives h–1 (max = 37 dives h–1). The median foraging range was 25 km (max = 68 km), whereas the median total distance traveled was 69 km (max = 179 km). Foraging site fidelity was high, and the orientation of foraging flights in any given day was similar among birds that departed at the same time. There were no sex-specific differences in 13 of 15 foraging variables; however, females dived slightly deeper and spent a larger proportion of time sitting on the water. We speculate that (1) the foraging behavior of Peruvian boobies contrasts with that of their tropical and temperate relatives as a result of the proximity and predictability of food sources, elevated energetic demands of the brood (up to 4 chicks) and high prey encounter rate in the Peruvian upwelling system, and (2) the lack of spatial segregation between sexes may be related to the attraction of birds to feeding aggregations that are formed in the vicinity of the colonies. Once the foraging patches are localized, females dive deeper because of passive mechanisms associated with a heavier mass.\n",

Si bien ya hemos estado siguiendo las tortugas capturadas en Gabón desde marzo de 2010, hemos empezado la telemetría satelital de las tortugas verdes de Guinea Ecuatorial sólo desde enero 2011. El proyecto tiene como objetivo examinar los patrones de alimentación basados en el tamaño individual de las tortugas verdes de la bahía de Corisco. Estos datos de movimiento se integrarán con una caracterización transfronteriza de los hábitat locales y con una evaluación de las amenazas antropogénicas, en Gabón y en Guinea Ecuatorial. Los resultados del proyecto ayudarán a las organizaciones locales e internacionales en la protección de esta especie en peligro de extinción global.**********************************************************In association with a regional marine biodiversity project, we are studying the movements of green turtles on their foraging grounds in Corisco Bay, which includes both Equato-Guinean and Gabonese waters.  While we have been tracking turtles captured in Gabon since March 2010, satellite tracking of green turtles from Equatorial Guinea began only recently, in January 2011. The project aims to examine size-based foraging patterns of the Corisco Bay population of green turtles.  These movement data will be integrated with a transborder characterization of the local habitat and an assessment of anthropogenic threats; some in Gabon, some in Equatorial Guinea.  The results of the project will assist local and international organisations to protect this globally endangered species.\n",

      "La baie de Corisco est une zone d'alimentation importante pour les tortues imbriquées (Eretmochelys imbricata), classés comme en danger critique à l'échelle mondiale. Après un certain nombre de «années perdues» en haute mer, les juvéniles recrutent pour les eaux littorales, loin de leurs plages natales. Zones rocheuses peu profondes convenables pour ce stade de développement se produisent uniquement dans la baie de Corisco, qui couvre les frontières du Gabon et de la Guinée équatoriale. Une meilleure compréhension de l'utilisation de l'habitat des tortues marines dans cette région est fondamental pour informer tous les efforts de conservation ou atténuation de l'impact ultérieures. En Novembre 2015, nous avons commencé baliser un petit échantillon de tortues imbriquées pour obtenir le premier oeil à leur utilisation de l'habitat marin de cette région.*****************************************************Corisco Bay hosts important foraging habitat for hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), classified as critically endangered globally.  After a number of “lost years” in the high seas, juveniles recruit to nearshore waters, far from their natal beaches.  Suitable shallow rocky areas for this developmental stage uniquely occur in Corisco Bay, which spans the borders of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. A better understanding of habitat use of sea turtles in this region is fundamental to inform all subsequent conservation or impact mitigation efforts. In November 2015, we began satellite tagging a small sample of hawksbill turtles to get the first ever look at their use of the marine habitat of this region.\n",

      "Vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) are any ecosystem that are highly vulnerable to one or more kinds of fishing activity or other disturbance, and are identified by the vulnerability of their components (e.g. habitats, communities or species). The South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention includes specific provisions to protect VMEs. SPRFMO has defined ten benthic invertebrate taxa that are regarded as indicators of VMEs. They are: Porifera (sponges); Actiniaria (anemones); Alcyonacea (soft corals); Gorgonacea (sea fans); Pennatulacea (sea pens); Scleractinia (stony corals); Antipatharia (black corals); Stylasteridae (hydrocorals); Crinoidea (sea lilies); and Brisingida (armless stars). For management purposes, it is important to know where VMEs are known or likely to occur, based on the best available scientific and technical information. The likely presence of VMEs can be identified using habitat suitability models for indicator taxa, ideally across the entire SPRFMO area. This is the aim of the South Pacific VME project. Records of VME indicator taxa extracted for the SPRFMO area and the New Zealand EEZ from OBIS (Online Biogeographic Information System: www.iobis.org) together with other online data sources, and data from research institutes (e.g., NIWA, CSIRO) and fisheries agencies (e.g. MPI, AFMA) were used for the project. These data were compiled and groomed prior to use in the habitat suitability modelling. Data in this dataset represent records of the VME indicator taxa as extracted from the variety of data sources listed above and may include records that are outside of the SPRFMO area.\n",

Two hundred thirty-seven species, or one-third, of the azooxanthellate species occur off Australia, making it one of the richest regions in the world for this type of coral. The purpose of this paper was not to re-describe the azooxanthellate coral fauna of Australia, as most of the species have been adequately described and figured within the last 15 years in papers about the Australian fauna or adjacent regions (Cairns, 1989a, 1994, 1995, 1998, 1999a; Cairns &amp; Parker, 1992; Cairns &amp; Zibrowius, 1997). Instead, the primary purpose is to document and verify all previously published records of the 237 Australian azooxanthellate species in the form of annotated synonymies, to augment these reports with additional records from the various Australian museums, and to list deposition of types and type localities for all species. This exhaustive compilation then provides the basis for a meaningful zoogeographic analysis of this fauna, the second goal of the paper.\n",

Biodiversity data in the Middle East marine environments (the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman, and the Persian Gulf) are scarce and are generally focused on larger taxa, while groups like sponges, ctenophores, octocorals, polychaetes, and tunicates are poorly known. On the other hand, most of the species diversity information of the region came from coral reef ecosystems, especially from the Red Sea. High maritime activities in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman as the major waterways for oil and gas transport and the lack of a documented database on total taxa diversity require greater attention for the biodiversity of these environments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to extract, standardize, and evaluate these biodiversity data. To fill a part of the gap, the Iranian National Institute for Oceanography and Atmospheric Science (INIOAS) was officially selected as a regional OBIS node in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman (PEGO-OBIS) Then, a project (project grant number: 392-011-05) was conducted entitled Gathering, standardization/digitization and interpretation of existing biological data of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman based on OBIS scheme.The presence Cnidarian occurrence data is part of the above project\n",

The islands and atolls (Ducie, Henderson, Oeno, and Pitcairn) are situated in the central South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and South America. We surveyed algae, corals, mobile invertebrates, and fishes at 97 sites between 5 and 30 m depth, and found 51 new records for algae, 23 for corals, and 15 for fishes. The structure of the ecological communities was correlated with age, isolation, and geomorphology of the four islands. Coral and algal assemblages were significantly different among islands with Ducie having the highest coral cover (56%) and Pitcairn dominated by erect macroalgae (42%). Fish biomass was dominated by top predators at Ducie (62% of total fish biomass) and at Henderson (35%). Herbivorous fishes dominated at Pitcairn, while Oeno showed a balanced fish trophic structure. We found high levels of regional endemism in the fish assemblages across the islands (45%), with the highest level observed at Ducie (56% by number). We conducted the first surveys of the deep habitats around the Pitcairn Islands using drop-cameras at 21 sites from depths of 78 to 1,585 m. We observed 57 fish species from the drop-cams, including rare species such as the false catshark (Pseudotriakis microdon) and several new undescribed species. In addition, we made observations of typically shallow reef sharks and other reef fishes at depths down to 300 m. Our findings highlight the uniqueness and high biodiversity value of the Pitcairn Islands as one of the least impacted in the Pacific, and suggest the need for immediate protection.\n",

In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down.

Historically, there are few zooplankton time series in Australia, with no datasets longer than two years prior to 2008. Here we compile 98,676 abundance records of more than 1,000 zooplankton taxa from unpublished research cruises, student projects, published literature and the recent Integrated Marine Observing System. This dataset covers the entire coastal and shelf region of Australia and dates back to 1938. Most records are for copepods, but there are also data for other taxa such as decapods, chaetognaths, thaliaceans, appendicularians and cladocerans. Metadata are provided for each record, including dates, coordinates and information on mesh size and sampling methods. To facilitate analysis across the multiple datasets, we have updated the species names according to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS; http://www.marinespecies.org/about.php) and converted units to abundance per m3. These data will be valuable for studies of biodiversity, biogeography, impacts of climate change and ecosystem health.

      "The identification of species is one of the most basic, and yet critically important, issues in biology with far-reaching potential implications for fields such as biodiversity conservation, population ecology and epidemiology. Morphology has long been the primary tool biologists have used to categorize life. However, we now know that a significant portion of natural diversity is morphologically hidden, and therefore, we must integrate nonmorphological tools into the description of biodiversity. Here, we demonstrate the utility of multilocus population genetic data for identifying and characterizing cryptic species complexes, even when species share large amounts of genetic variability. Specifically, we have used DNA sequence data from 12 genomic regions to characterize two widespread species complexes in the coral genus Acropora: A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus. These two morphospecies have each been sampled from 5 to 7 locations throughout their Indo-Pacific distributions, and with the use of structure and hierarchical clustering, we demonstrate the presence of at least six widespread cryptic species within these two morphospecies complexes. After identifying cryptic lineages, we then utilize the genetic data to examine the history of introgressive hybridization within and between these morphospecies complexes. Our data indicate that these two complexes form a global syngameon with consistent patterns of introgression between species across large geographic distributions.\n",

The survey aimed to fill these gaps do this by characterising the habitats and ecosystem processes in 200-700 m depths that sustain key species, and commencing a process to determine the relevant aspects of species ecology. Primarily this will be (1) to measure the movement of fish within and to/ from a large closed area in the GAB with a tagging program, and (2) estimate the abundance of selected species in relation to habitat features (substructure within submarine canyons, escarpments and rocky banks, and adjacent water column features) with two independent, non-extractive photographic methods.

The NBID component provides a basis for fulfilling important data needs of customers, such as providing information on the incidence and patterns of occurrence of a particular species of interest, or on the overall composition and diversity of species assemblages within any particular region of interest. Other key objectives of the NBID component are: (1) to provide a source of information for assessing patterns in marine biodiversity; (2) to provide input data for evaluating biological responses to sediment-associated stressors, and for developing new diagnostic tools to enhance such analyses; and (3) to provide a basis for monitoring the incidence and patterns of invasive species in marine and coastal waters (taking advantage of the fact that such a comprehensive database includes species from most all known marine invertebrate phyla, and thus will be broadly representative). Samples were live-sieved in the field on 0.5mm wire mesh sieves and all material retained on the screen was preserved with 10% buffered formalin with Rose Bengal dye. In the laboratory these previously fixed samples were re-sieved and transferred to a 70%-ethanol solution. All benthic macro-infauna retained on the 0.5mm screen were identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level, usually species. The level of taxonomy varied depending upon the salinity of the habitat from which the samples were collected. Oligochaetes and chironomids from tidal fresh and oligohaline salinity zones were identified to species (or lowest possible taxon) whereas individuals of these groups from higher salinities (&gt; 5 ppt) were not identified to the species level. Additionally, certain faunal groups were not identified to the species level due to inherent taxonomic difficulties associated with the group and the limited value to be gained relative to the effort required for the additional level of detail. These groups and the corresponding level of expected taxonomic classification are as follows: Phylum Porifera (Sponges); Phylum Ectoprocta (Bryozoans); Class Hydrozoa - Order (e.g., Hydroida, Actinulida); Class Hirudinea; Class Anthozoa - Order [e.g., Alcyonacea (soft corals), Gorgonacea (sea fans and whips), Pennnatulacea (sea pens), Actiniaria (sea anemones), Scleractinia, (stony corals), Ceriantharia]; Other Dipteran Families - Family (e.g., Ceratopogonidae, Chaoboridae).

Species are recorded as CAAB codes. Sample attributes include the voyage, location, time, sampling gear and sampled area. The dataset was created for the Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEW) for use in profiling of the North Marine Region during the development of a marine bioregional plan for the region. Data from all voyages are in a single set of tables and in the same structure and measurement units. The aim of the dataset is to provide convenient access to the data from the source datasets, which were stored in various data structures in various locations. Although the data are presented in uniform measurement units of counts and weights per unit area, data from different samples cannot be assumed to be comparable. In particular, the catchability of a species varies among types of sampling gears. Even samples from a given gear type on a given voyage may not all be comparable to one another. For example, gear may be altered during a voyage (e.g. multiple codend mesh sizes may be tried) and fish trawls are occasionally aimed at fish visible on the echo sounder. The data should therefore be analysed no more than semi-quantitatively. Assumptions on the comparability of samples -- even from a single voyage and gear type -- should be based on reference to the voyage reports.\n",

The method is presented in a logical step-by-step manner starting from selecting a study area through each type of measurement to entering the field data into the database, and finally, reporting the results. After a few days of training in habitat mapping and species identification, community members can use these step-by-step protocols to routinely monitor their site of interest or concern.

To achieve this, the project undertook 3-monthly seasonal sampling from 2003 - 2005 at a series of coastal sites situated between Cape Naturaliste in the south and Jurien Bay in the north. Benthic Sampling was integrated with satellite observations of SST, ocean colour and subsurface measurements of other water column properties, as well as sediment biogeochemical sampling. Within this region benthic sampling was nested at Regional (100s km) Local (10s km) and Site (1 km) scales and within each of the regions additional sites were sampled to incorporate site scale variability along cross-shore gradients.\n",

The dataset was created for the Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEW) for use in profiling of the North Marine Region during the development of a marine bioregional plan for the region. Data from all voyages are in a single set of tables and in the same structure and measurement units. The aim of the dataset is to provide convenient access to the data from the source datasets, which were stored in various data structures in various locations. Although the data are presented in uniform measurement units of counts and weights per unit area, data from different samples cannot be assumed to be comparable. In particular, the catchability of a species varies among types of sampling gears. Even samples from a given gear type on a given voyage may not all be comparable to one another. For example, gear may be altered during a voyage (e.g. multiple codend mesh sizes may be tried) and fish trawls are occasionally aimed at fish visible on the echo sounder. The data should therefore be analysed no more than semi-quantitatively. Assumptions on the comparability of samples -- even from a single voyage and gear type -- should be based on reference to the voyage reports.\n",

The method is presented in a logical step-by-step manner starting from selecting a study area through each type of measurement to entering the field data into the database, and finally, reporting the results. After a few days of training in habitat mapping and species identification, community members can use these step-by-step protocols to routinely monitor their site of interest or concern.

      "In 2012 we conducted an integrated ecological assessment of the marine environment of the Pitcairn Islands, which are four of the most remote islands in the world. The islands and atolls (Ducie, Henderson, Oeno, and Pitcairn) are situated in the central South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and South America. We surveyed algae, corals, mobile invertebrates, and fishes at 97 sites between 5 and 30 m depth, and found 51 new records for algae, 23 for corals, and 15 for fishes. The structure of the ecological communities was correlated with age, isolation, and geomorphology of the four islands. Coral and algal assemblages were significantly different among islands with Ducie having the highest coral cover (56%) and Pitcairn dominated by erect macroalgae (42%). Fish biomass was dominated by top predators at Ducie (62% of total fish biomass) and at Henderson (35%). Herbivorous fishes dominated at Pitcairn, while Oeno showed a balanced fish trophic structure. We found high levels of regional endemism in the fish assemblages across the islands (45%), with the highest level observed at Ducie (56% by number). We conducted the first surveys of the deep habitats around the Pitcairn Islands using drop-cameras at 21 sites from depths of 78 to 1,585 m. We observed 57 fish species from the drop-cams, including rare species such as the false catshark (Pseudotriakis microdon) and several new undescribed species. In addition, we made observations of typically shallow reef sharks and other reef fishes at depths down to 300 m. Our findings highlight the uniqueness and high biodiversity value of the Pitcairn Islands as one of the least impacted in the Pacific, and suggest the need for immediate protection.\n",

      "Since November 1995, the CARIACO Ocean Time Series program has been studying the relationship between surface primary production (carbon fixation rates by photosynthesis of planktonic algae), regional hydrography, physical forcing variables (such as the wind), and the settling flux of particulate organic carbon in the Cariaco Basin. This tectonic depression, located on the continental shelf of Venezuela, shows marked seasonal and interannual variation in hydrography and primary production induced in part by the regular migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).\n",
      "The Cariaco Basin hydrography is affected by North-Atlantic gyre-scale processes, including dispersal of Subtropical Underwater and western boundary current variability, cross-equatorial flow of water masses (Wust, 1964; Muller-Karger et al., 1989), wind-driven upwelling compounded by geostrophic circulation (Richards, 1975; Muller-Karger and Aparicio-Castro, 1994i), ventilation forced by Caribbean Sea eddies (Astor et al., 2003), and river discharge (Yarincik et al., 2000; Lorenzoni, et al. 2009). Due to its restricted circulation and high primary production, the basin is anoxic below ~250 m (Muller-Karger et al., 2001; 2010). In the late 1990's and early 2000's, CARIACO observations measured annual primary production rates of more than 500 gC/m²y, of which over 15-20% was generated by events lasting one month or less. Since 2004 there has been a decrease in primary production rates (annual averages of less than 400 gC/m²y). Still, the annual primary production rates in the Cariaco Basin are comparable to rates estimated using time series observations for Monterey Bay (460 gC/m² y; Chavez, 1996), and higher than rates estimated for Georges Bank, the New York Shelf, and the Oregon Shelf (380, 300, and 190 gC/m² y, respectively; Walsh, 1988). Primary production and vertical particulate organic matter fluxes in the Cariaco Basin are higher than those observed at the oligotrophic BATS and HOT locations (Karl et al., 2001; Steinberg et al., 2001; Thunell et al., 2007). The Basin also experiences sedimentological events caused by earthquakes (Thunell et al., 1999; Lorenzoni et al., 2012) and coastal flooding (Percy et al., 2008; Lorenzoni et al., 2009). All of these phenomena can influence the sediments.\n",

      "Purpose:\n",
      "On November 1, 2013, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced Dominion Virginia Power was the provisional winner of the commercial lease area offshore of Virginia (VA WEA). Development of off shore wind energy poses potential threats to marine mammals, including direct effects (i.e. vessel interactions, collision and entanglement with structures, displacement, avoidance, or injury due to noise from construction or operations) and indirect threats (i.e. effects on prey species, increased risk of fishery and vessel interaction through displacement out of the WEA) (BOEM 2012). This information is important to mitigate the potentially harmful impacts from ocean development, shipping, and other anthropogenic activities. To address these existing data gaps, we have collected marine mammal and sea turtle sighting data from aerial surveys conducted off the coast of Virginia from May 2014 to December 2014.\n",

The zonation and percent biomass of the species were recorded.  The second section of the report is a continuation of a saltmarsh insect survey which started in 1977.  Samples helped determine distribution data and determined the number of Cicadellidae (hoppers) and Delphacidae (planthoppers) in the Wolfville saltmarsh area.  The final two sections describe studies of invertebrate populations found on the intertidal mudflats in the southern bight of the Minas Basin and Scot's Bay.  These studies were the first to examine biodiversity of the tidal flats in their respective areas. \n",

The catch of each species in a sample is recorded as raw weight and count, gross weight and count (raw values divided by the subsampling fraction) and per area weight and count. Species are recorded as CAAB codes. Sample attributes include the voyage, location, time, sampling gear and sampled area. The dataset was created for the Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEW) for use in profiling of the North Marine Region during the development of a marine bioregional plan for the region. Data from all voyages are in a single set of tables and in the same structure and measurement units. The aim of the dataset is to provide convenient access to the data from the source datasets, which were stored in various data structures in various locations. Although the data are presented in uniform measurement units of counts and weights per unit area, data from different samples cannot be assumed to be comparable. In particular, the catchability of a species varies among types of sampling gears. Even samples from a given gear type on a given voyage may not all be comparable to one another. For example, gear may be altered during a voyage (e.g. multiple codend mesh sizes may be tried) and fish trawls are occasionally aimed at fish visible on the echo sounder. The data should therefore be analysed no more than semi-quantitatively. Assumptions on the comparability of samples -- even from a single voyage and gear type -- should be based on reference to the voyage reports.\n",

At each site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and benthic composition information is then quantified following standardized protocols.

Isla Cayo Serranilla, está ubicada en el Archipiélago de San Andrés Providencia y Santa Catalina Colombia mar Caribe. El muestreo efectivo en la Isla fue de 10 días, realizado en el mes de septiembre de 2017, en dicho lugar se instalaron 7 tipos de trampas entre las cuales se cuentan 2 sacos Winkler, una Malaise, 2 trampa de luz, una de intersección aérea, 2 Van Someren Rydon, 7 pitfall, 2 de esencia, distribuidas de forma aleatoria. Con base en la observación de la cobertura vegetal dominante y con el fin de cubrir la mayor heterogeneidad posible del ecosistema de la Isla, también se utilizó métodos directos como jama, frasco aspirador y captura manual.\n",

      "Por otro lado y con objetivo de caracterizar la flora y fauna terrestre de la isla cayo Serranilla, se realizaron muestreos independientes para cada grupo taxonómico y adicionalmente se evaluó la abundancia de reptiles, crustáceos y moluscos dentro de las parcelas de vegetación para tener una visión más integral de la biodiversidad terrestre de la zona.\n",
      "Durante la expedición llevada a cabo en el 2017 se caracterizó un total de 293 registros de la Isla Cayo Serranilla.\n",
